2[R[Merc-c].] has more excoriation and burning, 2[more activity and excitement.]

R[Merc]. is slower and more sluggish. 2[R[Merc-c].] is violent and active in its movements, it takes hold and runs its course with greater activity. So with a R[Merc] base we have often to prefer this salt.

In the I[eye] symptoms there is more excoriation. The pains, burning, smarting, etc., in the eruptions and ulcers are more violent. In 2[R[Merc].] we have slow spreading ulcers, but in 2[R[Merc-c].] there is 2[great eating]; it will spread over an area as large as your hand in a night. He has the mercurial odor and sweat, and he is sallow; he needs R[Merc], but a more active preparation than 2[R[Merc-v]]

R[Merc-c].] has decided symptoms of its own, but they are limited. You cannot tell the ptyalism, or the lardaceous ulcers apart.

In 2[sore throat,] if it is a 2[R[Merc]. case,] the ulcers are spreading rapidly and burning and smarting like coals of fire, you would say that 2[R[Merc].] is not so intense as this. You need 2[R[Merc-c]. for the I[violence,] the I[intense burning], and the I[rapid spread.]]I[] The throat is enormously swollen, the glands are swollen, and the thirst is insatiable.

In 2[dysentery] there is more violence; copious bleeding; great anxiety, can scarcely leave the stool a second, great tenesmus of rectum and bladder; urging to urination and stool is constant; great burning in the rectum. It is a violent case of dysentery. I would prefer 2[R[Merc].] in ordinary 2[R[Merc].] cases, but if this patient is not relieved he will not live, and 2[R[Merc-c].] is needed here.

In the 2[urinary organs] the symptoms are violent. 2[Albuminuria] is more marked in 2[R[Merc-c].] than in 2[R[Merc].] It is one of the most frequently indicated remedies in the albuminuria of pregnancy and a very useful remedy when gout is present.

From slight irritation of the foreskin of the male organ, the mucous membrane and skin contract and phimosis takes place.

2[R[Merc-c].] relieves the itching and burning, and causes the purse-string to let up. It is seldom indicated in gonorrhoea, but is called for when there is greenish yellow or bloody watery discharge, with violent burning and urging to urination and to stool, and violent painful erections. Chancres spread with great rapidity.

Stitching, rending, tearing pains, here and there, especially in the chest.
