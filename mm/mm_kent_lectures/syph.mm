Whenever the symptoms that are representative of the patient himself have been suppressed in any case of syphilis, and nothing remains but weakness and a few results of the storm that has long ago or recently passed, this nosode will cause reaction and restore order and sometimes do much curing, and the symptoms that must always be present, that represent the disordered state of the economy will appear to guide to a restoration of health.

When a syphilitic patient has suffered from a course of typhoid he may be very slow in convalescing, but a single dose of 2[R[Syph]] high will cause him to eat and feel stronger and gain rapidly.

How does the old school treatment of syphilis differ from barbarism? one might well ask. The strong drugging by 2[R[Merc]] and 2[iodides] so debilitate that all who pass through are invalids and weak; even then they are not cured of syphilis - if they were cured we could not cause to come back the symptoms that have been removed.

2[R[Syph]] often does bring back the ulcers in the throat and the eruptions. When there are violent neuralgias of the head, in sides of head and over the eyes, great soreness in bones of legs and head, and the multitude of symptoms of nerve syphilis all nondescript, then it is that the patient will be made free from suffering, and given sleep, strength and appetite.

But the ulcers and eruptions will come back in some cases, and it is all the better if they do. It is by no means limited to patients who have had syphilis. It can be used like any remedy against the symptoms of the provings, or such as are similar to symptoms common to the disease or against the symptoms like the numerous verified clinical symptoms.

Many symptoms are worse at night in bed, many come on in the evening and last till morning. 2[From sundown to sunrise] marks the time of many violent pains and sufferings. Some are better from heat, and some are better from cold air and cold applications, There is great prostration in the morning on waking. It has cured many cases of epilepsy. Epileptic convulsions after -menses. 2[Sleeplessness,] sometimes only one-half of the night, again the whole night. The blood feels hot flowing through the arteries during the night.

Wandering pains here and there all over the body. Pain in the periosteum, nerves and joints. Pains sometimes increase gradually and decrease gradually. Sharp pains here and there. Complaints worse in the cold weather of winter and heat of summer. Extreme emaciation. Abscesses. Paralysis of limbs. Caries of bone. Curvature of spine. Gummata. 2[Dwarfish children.] Curvature of bones. Enlarged glands. Offensive odor of the body. Soreness to touch in many parts, especially bones. It has often been observed that in syphilized invalids remedies act but a few days and must be changed.

This always calls for the nosode, when there is only great weakness and few symptoms it will act well.

When there is ulceration of legs, throat, mouth or other parts with no repair. Fistulous openings, exostoses, fissures, tubercles and warts have been cured promptly. When it has been used against the primary manifestations of the disease and in the earlier phenomena it has generally resulted in failure. It is seldom the best remedy for syphilis 2[per se,] but for marked and suppressed syphilis it seems to restore a sort of order and bring better reaction.

The author has many times observed that gummata in throat and anus will take on destructive ulceration in old broken down cases after 2[R[Sulph]] has been given, and that 2[R[Syph]] will restrain it and establish repair.

2[R[Sulph]] often produces prolonged aggravation when there are many tissue changes in advanced cases of syphilis. Such changes are most likely gummata. The effort of 2[R[Sulph]] is to remove the results of disease, which the patient cannot stand. It often causes suspicion of latent syphilis when such aggravations are very severe after 2[R[Sulph]] high. 2[R[Sulph]] low will not be followed by such results. After such prolonged aggravations 2[R[Syph]] should be considered. Latent syphilis often exists where it is least expected. This nosode should be used only in high potencies.
