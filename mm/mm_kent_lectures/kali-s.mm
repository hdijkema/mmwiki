Two very deep acting remedies unite to form this one. It was left to 2[Sch√ºessler] to show its first curative powers.

2[Dewey's] work, on the "2[Tissue Remedies]" gives the best presentation from the biochemic view. The writer gathered the symptoms from reported cures for many years, and found that they were justified by the study of the two remedies entering into the formation.



:rubric=Generals

Many of these symptoms come out upon the sick as aggravations. Some of these are only cured symptoms. This arrangement could be improved upon much by provings. If the reader will carefully use this remedy as herein directed he will be astonished at its depth of action, and if he uses it high he will be surprised at the length of action of every dose.

It has cured epilepsy, lupus and epithelioma, and many desquamating skin affections. It has cured most obstinate case of chronic intermittent fever. It is useful in catarrhal affections with thick yellow or greenish pus, viscid or thin 2[yellow watery discharges.]

MostI[] symptoms are aggravated in the evening. The patient craves fresh and even cold air, and he is ameliorated in open air and cool air. Aggravation by exertion and becoming heated. Complaints come on during rest, and are ameliorated by motion. Complaints aggravated in warm room. Takes cold from being overheated.

When once heated he cannot cool off without taking cold. 2[Predisposition to phthisis.] It is frequently indicated after 2[R[Tub].] Epileptiform convulsions. Jerking of the limbs and twitching of muscles. Dropsical condition of the extremities. Loss of flesh, and complaints aggravated after eating. Fasting ameliorates many symptoms. Flabby muscles. Fatty degeneration of glands, liver and heart. Heaviness of limbs and weariness of the body.

Hysterical symptoms. Sluggishness of the body and lack of physical irritability. Well selected remedies fall short in action. Wants to lie down, but lying in bed aggravates; he must walk about to ameliorate his sufferings. Surging of blood in the body.

Complaints dating back to suppressed eruptions. Post scarlatinal nephritis. One does not need to reflect to perceive this I[is] 2[R[Puls]] somewhat intensified. It takes up the work and finishes as a complement of 2[R[Puls],] unless, as in some instances, the patient becomes a cold and chilly subject and is better during rest, and then 2[R[Sil]] often will be found to have what symptoms remain.

It is usual for a patient under a deep acting remedy to go to opposite modalities, and hence 2[R[Puls].] is so often followed by 2[R[Sil]]; but this is not always true. When 2[R[Puls].] has acted well for a time and because of opposite modalities 2[R[Sil]] does good work for a while, and then the patient swings back to the original state, symptoms and modalities, then it is that 2[R[Kali-s].] is of great usefulness.

What occurs is the same as when 2[R[Sulph]., R[Calc] and R[Lyc],] have rotated in a given case too deep to be cured by a single remedy and a series of remedies has been what was required because the symptoms changed in such a manner that such a series was homeopathically suited.
