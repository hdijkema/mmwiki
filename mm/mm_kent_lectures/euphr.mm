The remedy has a rash like measles and it has febrile symptoms; therefore, when these symptoms are duly considered, it will be seen that 2[R[Euphr]] is similar to the symptoms that occur in measles. It is a wonderful medicine in measles though not so frequently indicated as 2[R[Puls],] owing to the fact that this combination of symptoms does not often come.
