When treating a low form of continued fever with extreme prostration 2[R[Ars], R[Mur-ac] and R[Ph-ac]] force themselves upon the mind.

With 2[R[Ars]] there has been the anxious restlessness; with 2[R[Ph-ac]] there has been the mental prostration, and then the muscular weakness; with 2[R[Mur-ac]] the muscular weakness comes first, and there has been history of restlessness and the mind has been stronger than could be expected.

With this great muscular exhaustion with jaw hanging down and the patient sliding down in bed and soon the involuntary stool and urine, this remedy is forced upon the mind. Paralytic weakness is what it must be called.

A stout, full blooded jaundiced man about forty had suffered much from pain in the liver, with great soreness, was comfortable only when lying on left side; when he turned on his back or right side an anxious vertigo would come at once and he would break out in copious sweat, and be forced back to the left side. 2[R[Mur-ac]] made a complete cure of this liver trouble, which had been pronounced serious.
