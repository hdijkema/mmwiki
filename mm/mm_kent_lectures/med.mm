:rubric=Children

One of the many uses of this remedy is in the inherited complaints of children.

The physician of long and active experience meets many obstinate cases in children. The infant soon emaciates and becomes marasmic, or a child becomes asthmatic, or suffers with vicious catarrh of nose or eyelids, or has ringworm on the scalp or face, or is dwarfed; and after some waste of time it comes to mind that the father was treated for gonorrhea that was obstinate and perhaps had condylomata on the genitalia.

This remedy will cure, or begin the recovery. The woman married several years desires to become a mother. She was healthy when she married, but now she has ovarian pains, menstrual troubles, she has lost all sexual response, is growing pale and waxy, and becoming violently sensitive and nervous.

The husband's history gives the cause, and this remedy will cure. The pale waxy young men, who crave stimulants and tobacco, who are sensitive to drafts, become stiff after exertion and walking, who perspire easily and are extremely sensitive to cold, who have never been well since having a gonorrhea cured by injections.



:rubric=Rheumatic symptoms

in every part of the body. Some symptoms are worse in the daytime. The usual comparison with 2[R[Syph],] which reads,

"2[R[Med]. in daytime and I[Syph.] at night,"] does not hold good as a sweeping statement. It is true that many I[Syph.] pains are worse nights.

It is true that some sycotic and 2[R[Med]] symptoms are worse daytimes. It is also true that many sycotic symptoms are violent day and night. It is also true that the mental symptoms of 2[R[Med].] are most violent at night. It will not do to be too sweeping with circumstances of this nosode.

The rheumatic inflammations are worse from motion, but where swelling is not present these patients act like 2[R[Rhus-t]] patients; they are sensitive to cold, suffer from aching and torturesome pains, and find relief only in motion - like I[R[Rhus-t].] Most sycotic patients suffer from cold, some are sensitive to heat.
