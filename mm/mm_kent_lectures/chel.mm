2[R[Chel]] is a remedy more suitable for acute diseases, though it cures certain chronic conditions. It is not a very deep acting remedy. It is about like 2[R[Bry]] in its general plane, length and depth of action.

It has been used principally in gastric and intestinal catarrhs, in acute and semi-chronic liver troubles, and in right-sided pneumonia.



:rubric=Skin

The skin is likely to be sallow, and gradually increases to a marked jaundice in connection with these complaints. Semi-chronic gastritis, with jaundice.

"Gastro-duodenal catarrh.

Congestion and soreness in the liver, with jaundice.

Right-sided pneumonia, complicated with liver troubles, or jaundice."

This remedy seems to act throughout the system, but almost always along with it the liver is involved, and it is suitable for what the old people and the doctors called "2[biliousness.]" The patient is generally bilious, has nausea and vomiting. Distension of the veins. Yellowish grey color of the skin.



:rubric=Mind

Very few mental symptoms have been brought out in its proving not enough to give us a good idea of the desires and aversions. We do not get a clear idea of the intellectual faculties. It needs further proving, yet in many regions it has had superabundance of proving.

"Sadness and anxiety."

Brooding over some sort of trouble generally runs through the mental state.

"Anxiety, allowing no rest," keeping the patient uneasy day and night.

Sadness, as if she had committed a crime; as if some dreadful thing was going to happen. So sad that she thinks she must die

"Weeping despondency.

Distaste for mental exertion and conversation.

If you examine those medicines that act primarily upon the liver, that slow down the action of the liver, you will find the word melancholia."

With heart troubles, great excitement, With liver troubles, slowing down of the mental state, inability of the mind to work, sluggishness of the mind, inability to think, inability to meditate, slow pulse. Sluggishness of the whole economy.



:rubric=Dizziness

The sensorium is very commonly disturbed, and the patient is dizzy.

"Things go round in a circle."

Dizziness comes, and it does not let up until nausea, and sometimes vomiting, follows.

"So much turning in the head that he vomits.

Confusion of mind.

Loss of consciousness and fainting."

These are also common features with liver troubles.

The mind symptoms are present more or less with the following liver symptoms; there are pains of a dull aching character, "2[soreness.]" Bruised pains. Tenderness of the liver to touch. Aching pains, that seem to involve the whole right lobe of the liver; creating a sensation of fullness. Pressure upwards, with difficulty of breathing. Pressure downwards, sympathetic with the stomach, with the nausea and vomiting.



:rubric=Right scapula

And then more intense pain felt 2[under the right scapula.]

"Dull aching pains under the right scapula; sharp, shooting pains under the right scapula"; these complicate themselves again with pneumonia, with pleurisy.

It cures pneumonia and pleurisy; it cures various forms of congestion in the liver, when these pains go from before backward, and seem to be felt through the back.

"Stitching in the region of the liver, extending through to back.

Hard pains felt through the back."

Some patients will describe these pains as shooting pains; some as tearing pains, and others as sharp pains, going through the right hypochondrium or through the right lobe of the liver to the back.

"Pains from the region of the liver, shooting towards the back and shoulders.

Spasmodic pain in the region of the liver.

Pressing pain in the region of the liver."

In congestion or inflammation, fullness and enlargement, semi-chronic cases, or even acute, this medicine proves suitable for such conditions. The right hypochondrium is tense and painful to pressure.

This remedy has cured gall stone colic. Practitioners, who know how to direct a remedy, relieve gall stone colic in a few minutes. We have remedies that act on the circular fibres of these little tubes, causing them to relax and allow the stone to pass painlessly.

In a perfect state of health, of course, there are no stones in the bile that is held in the gall bladder, but this little cystic duct opens its mouth and a little gall stone engages in it, and it creates and irritation by scratching along the mucous membrane of that little tube.

When this pain is a shooting, stabbing, tearing, lancinating pain, extending through to the back, R[Chel] will cure it. The instant it relieves the patient says:

"Why, what a relief; the pain has gone."

The remedy has relieved that spasm, the little duct opens up and the stone passes out through the ductus communis choledochus. Every remedy that is indicated by the symptoms will cure gall stone colic.

A patient lying in bed, with great heat, extreme sensitiveness, cannot have the body touched, screaming with pains, red face and hot head, will gall stone colic, will be relieved in three minutes by 2[R[Bell].,] but that is not at all like this remedy. 2[R[Nat-s].] and many other remedies have cured gall stone colic in a few minutes, when the symptoms agreed.

Now as to the pneumonia, it is generally of the right side, or right sided spreading to the left. The right-sidedness is marked, and but small portions of the left lung are involved. The pleura is generally involved, and so there are stitching, tearing pains.

One may not practice long before be will find a 2[R[Chel]] patient, sitting up in bed with high fever, bending forward upon his elbows, holding himself perfectly still, for this medicine has as much aggravation from motion as 2[R[Bry].] All of the pains are extremely aggravated from motion.

This patient is sitting with a pain that transfixes him; he cannot stir, he cannot move without - the pain shooting through him like a knife.

The next day you will see that his skin is growing yellow. If you see him in the beginning 2[R[Chel]] will relieve him and you will prevent that pneumonia. It is not uncommon in children, and it is extremely common in adults.

Do not get confused with 2[R[Bry].] Both are violently worse from motion. 2[R[Bry]] wants to lie on the painful side, or wants to lie on the back if the pneumonia is mostly in the posterior part of the right lung. In 2[R[Chel]] he is worse from touch and motion.

2[R[Bell].] has that extremely painful, tearing, rending, of the right lung with pleurisy, but I[in] 2[R[Bell].,] one cannot touch that right side, cannot press it, but must lie on the other side and he cannot move.

Cannot stand a jar of the bed, because of the extreme sensitiveness to motion: I mention all three in this particular way because they have some things in common, but the remedies are different.
