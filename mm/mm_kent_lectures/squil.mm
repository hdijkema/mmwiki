2[R[Squil]] was given in the olden times by the old school in all lung, bronchial, and kidney affections; pneumonia, asthma, scanty urine and dropsical affections.



:rubric=Cough

Has a loose morning cough and a dry evening cough 2[(R[Alum]., I[R[Carb-v]., R[Ph-ac]., R[Sep]., R[Stram]., R[Puls].,] R[Squil]).]

2[R[Puls]. and R[Squil],] being strong here, but 2[R[Squil].] has a hard cough; coughs, gags, sneezes; urine escapes and quite frequently faeces; the patient coughs until be is covered with sweat; he gags and coughs and finally succeeds in raising two or three little lumps of white, tenacious mucus; it is a spasmodic cough caused by mucus in the trachea or a tickling, creeping sensation in the chest.

The loose morning cough is worse than the dry evening cough. Patient chilly cannot have the least draft; wants plenty of clothing and is very sensitive to cold; not so in 2[R[Puls].] Urine is generally copious, watery, colorless.

About 11 A.M. to 12 or 1 P.M. there is the most dyspnoea from filling up of the chest with mucus; this same feeling returns during the hour, but it is from cardiac weakness.

Copious, colorless urine is one of its important symptoms and resembles 2[R[Ign].,] but 2[R[Squil].] is not a hysterical patient like 2[R[Ign].]

Quite similar to 2[R[Cann-i]. or I[R[Gels]]]I[.] in brain affections, but 2[R[Squil].] has not many brain affections nor many febrile symptoms. 2[R[Phos].] has inflammation of the brain and when the dangerous turn comes this increase of urine is a bad sign.

2[R[Puls],] tearful, then copious urine. 2[R[Squil].] copious colorless urine in diabetes; when this seems to disappear and chest symptoms appear, these troubles disappear and kidney troubles appear, these would disappear and dropsy comes up; when the urine would get copious again these dropsical symptoms would disappear and 2[R[Squil].] acts a long time.

There is a copious, colorless flow from the nose, more especially in the morning; the cough is similar to 2[R[Ant-t].]

R[Squil].] in its internal nature is quite like 2[R[Thuj]] in regard to its spurting urine and its spasmodic cough; with the escape of urine there is more or less of escape of faeces of a dark brown or black fluid in frothy bubbles, very offensive, painless, involuntary.

Respiration difficult with stitches in the chest when breathing and coughing. Great dyspnoea, the child cannot drink; seizes the cup eagerly, but can drink only in sips; frequently obliged to take a deep breath which provokes a cough; shortness of breath on every exertion.



:rubric=Chest

Pains in the chest aggravated in the morning. Dull rheumatic pains aggravated when exercising; ameliorated while at rest. Evening dry cough with sweetish expectoration. Great heat in the body. Follows well after 2[R[Bry].] Absolute lack of sweat is a characteristic.

Dry cough at 11 P.M. worse from cold water and cold air I[(]2[R[Rumx]]). 2[R[Bell].] has cough at 11 P.M. worse from uncovering, red face, congestion in head. 2[R[Lach].] soon after going to sleep, which may be 11 P.I[M.]

Nasal discharge acrid, corroding, worse in the morning; violent sneezing. Stool dark brown or black.

Seldom much cough during day.

Pneumonia: Stitches when inhaling, jerking pains; always right side; catarrh of the chest and threatened pneumonia after hemorrhage from the lungs. Soreness in the chest, worse from motion. 2[R[Bry].] will often palliate and the case will go into R[Squil].
