Proved by 2[Hahnemann, Hering] and others.

Persons who are in the habit of taking carbonate of soda for sour stomach get a proving of this remedy. I have met some of these people and been able to confirm many 2[Natrum] symptoms.

Old dyspeptics who are always belching and have sour stomach and rheumatism; after twenty years they are stoop-shouldered, pale, sensitive to cold, chilly, aggravated by the least draft; require much clothing; unable to resist the cold or the heat; require a medium climate; are worse from the changes of the weather; their digestive, rheumatic, and gouty troubles are all worse from the weather changes.



:rubric=Mind

A state of trepidation from the slightest noise, the slam of a door; nervous excitement and palpitation with great prostration; nervous weakness with trepidation; weakness from slight exertion of mind or body; internal and external trembling.

The rattling of paper causes palpitation, irritability and melancholy. Estrangement from family and friends. Aversion to mankind and to society; to relatives, to strangers; feels a great division between himself and them; sensitive to, certain persons.

Music causes a tendency to suicide, melancholy, weeping and trepidation; playing the piano is so exhausting that she must lie down; music causes great sadness which increases to religious insanity.

This is true of all the 2[Sodiums,] but especially so of R[Nat-c].; aggravation from the slam of a door, a pistol shot, which causes headache and complaints in general, aggravated from music.



:rubric=Digestion

The more soda these patients take, the more flatulent do they become; they are stoop-shouldered; digestion is difficult, and finally milk will not digest at all, bringing on a diarrhoea with undigested, lienteric stools; also, starch causes flatulence and looseness of the bowels, Many symptoms from drinking cold water when overheated.

Urine offensive like that of a horse, from a vegetable or milk diet. This is not so marked as in 2[R[Nit-ac].,] but resembles it.



:rubric=Skin

2[R[Nat-c].] throws out eruptions upon the knuckles and fingertips; also the toes; vesicular eruptions open up and form ulcers on the joints of finger-tips.

2[R[Bor], R[Sep], I[R[Ars].,] and R[Nat-c]]. are the remedies most inclined to produce ulceration of the tips and knuckles of the fingers, and also the toes.

Vesicular eruptions on the body in patches and circles; the herpes family is especially, related to 2[R[Nat-c].]; zona, herpes labialis, herpes preputialis; patches as large as a dollar on the hips, thighs and back. Smaller patches show vesicles containing a white serum, burning, smarting and itching, better from scratching.

The eruption passes away with a crust, but will often ulcerate, it does not heal and an ulcer forms. Circulation feeble; wounds suppurate. Feet and skin burn. Crusty eruptions on the skin that have not been vesicular; but most 2[R[Nat-c]. and R[Nat-m].] eruptions are of the vesicular form. Tingling, biting, itching, changing place, now here and now there; cold skin; sweaty body.



:rubric=Mind

Nervous exhaustion, physical exhaustion, weakness of mind and body.

So are the 2[Natrum] babies in general.

Accumulation of mucus in the throat and posterior nares, generally yellow in color, while with 2[R[Nat-m].] it is white; the latter spits up copious, thick, white mouthfuls.

2[R[Nat-c].] is ameliorated by eating; when chilly, he eats and is able to keep warm; the pains are ameliorated after eating; he has an all gone feeling and pain in the stomach which drives him to eat; he gets hungry at 5 A.M. and 11 P.M. 5 A.M. is the favorite time for the 2[R[Nat-c].] aggravation; he becomes so hungry at this time that he is forced out of bed to eat something, which also ameliorates the pain.
