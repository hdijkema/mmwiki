:rubric=Introduction

This a very valuable remedy should be more frequently used. It is indicated in such conditions as are cured by 2[R[Bry]] and 2[R[Rhus-t],] but its symptoms mark out its own individual cases.

Rheumatic conditions with heart irritation; epistaxis; bloody urine; anxiety and trembling, when there has been a history of diarrhoea. A suddenly checked diarrhoea will be followed by violent cardiac symptoms; it is much like 2[R[Led], R[aur] and I[R[Kalm].]]



:rubric=Marasmus

In marasmus of children it is a very useful remedy and not unfrequently indicated. The emaciation begins 2[in the lower limbs and gradually spreads upward,] so that the face is the last affected; that is the opposite of 2[R[Lyc], R[Nat-m] and I[R[Psor].]]



:rubric=Chest

2[] It has cured pleurisy after 2[R[Bry],] which seemed indicated, had failed. A woman lying in bed with dyspnoea, anxiety, cold sweat and pain in the heart was surrounded by friends to see her die.

It was learned that she had suffered for many months with a rheumatism in one knee, that she had used crutches to get about the house, and that she had recently been speedily cured (?) by a strong liniment only a few days before this attack. 2[R[Abrot].] restored her to health promptly.

It has caused and cured burning ulcerative pains in the stomach with suspicious vomiting.



:rubric=Metastasis

Metastasis is a marked feature in 2[R[Abrot].] The changing of one so called disease into another always calls attention to R[Abrot]. Inflammation of the parotid (mumps) changing to tests or mammae is generally cured by 2[R[Carb-v]] or 2[R[Puls],] but 2[R[Abrot],] has cured when these remedies have failed.



:rubric=Suppression

A suddenly checked diarrhea followed by piles and acute rheumatism, with bleedings, as mentioned above, is further argument in favor of this idea.

The R[Abrot]. patient is sensitive to cold air and cold damp weather. He suffers much from backaches, and his symptoms are worse during the night.

In boys it cures hydrocele.

In infants it cures bleeding from the navel.
