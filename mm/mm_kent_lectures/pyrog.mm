:rubric=Fever

2[] The potencies prepared from 2[Heath's] 3d of decomposed beef have been used by the author for many years against all forms of septic fever and sequelae, when the symptoms agree.

Violent chill intermingled with heat and sweat, or dry heat with marked aching in the limbs; restlessness, > by motion and heat. The sore bruised condition is as marked as in 2[R[Arn] and I[R[Bapt]]]I[;] the aching in the bones like 2[R[Eup-per],] the restlessness, > by motion and heat like 2[R[Rhus-t].]

Pains all aggravated sitting. Complaints come on from becoming cold, and from cold damp weather.

These features are found in hectic fevers in the last stages of phthisis, as well as septic fevers. It aborts puerperal fever in a few hours when clearly indicated. In cases of typhoid where there is the confusion like - that found in 2[R[Bapt]] and the heat is too intense for that remedy, 2[R[pyrog]] should always be considered.

When the temperature reaches 106Â° and there is great soreness and aching this remedy will make great changes in a single day; but if the pains are > by motion and heat it will abort the fever.

When the pulse is extremely high, and the temperature not correspondingly high this remedy will be useful. On the other hand, when the pulse and temperature are out of rhythm either way this remedy should be considered if the case is of septic origin. Great pain when the flow from an open abscess becomes scanty. 2[Violent burning in an abscess (R[Ars]., R[Anthr]., R[Tarent-c]]).

Offensiveness prevails extensively; even putrid and cadaveric odors of body, breath, sweat and discharges. Fevers from sewer gas poisoning; erysipelas from infection and surgical fevers. It cures many chronic complaints that date back to septic conditions. She has not been well since a puerperal fever many years ago, is a good reason for thinking of 2[R[pyrog].]

A young man of good inheritance suffered from blood poison and made a poor recovery, and for several years was affected with abscesses in various parts. He was pale and sickly, rheumatic and stiff; at this time there was an abscess of the calf slowly forming. He took 2[R[pyrog]] and made a rapid and complete recovery. This time the abscess did not open. He has remained in good health now ten years.

It has cured 2[Bright's] disease that could be traced to septic origin It is a most useful remedy when there is threatening heart failure in septic and zymotic fevers. Septic hemorrhage, when the blood is dark. It will often save life in the most dangerous and rapid septic fevers.
