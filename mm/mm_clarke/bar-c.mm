:rubric=Characteristics.
S{R[Bar-c] corresponds to scrofulous conditions in children and old age; dwarfish children and childish old people. Old people who are fat. Those liable to take cold easily; sore throat from cold; glandular affections. Many cases of aneurism have been cured with R[Bar-c], mostly in lower attenuations. It corresponds to the atheromatous condition. A paralytic condition runs throughout the pathogenesis. There is paralysis of mind and body. Mistrust; want of self-confidence; aversion to strangers (the child does not want to play). It has cured a case of fetid foot-sweat with spells of despondency, seeking solitude, sobbing and crying. Deficient memory (children cannot remember and learn). Sensation as if brain loose. Vertigo: with nausea; from stooping; when lifting arms up; in old people. Pressure and sticking in brain, at vertex on waking. It has cured baldness in young people; tinea, wens. The scalp is very sensitive to touch. Enlarged glands in occiput and neck. On the face there are rough, dry and herpetic eruptions. Dark redness. Tension of whole face as if white of egg had dried on it; as if a cobweb (R[Bar-ac]) over face, temples, and scalp. Painful swelling of parotid and of submaxillary glands. The sense of smell is very acute. There is an illusion of smell as of pine smoke. Nose-bleed before menses. The tongue is paralysed. Salivation; saliva runs out during sleep. The digestion is weak; after eating, pressing in stomach; and pain in hard, swollen abdomen. Sensation of soreness of stomach; while eating it feels as if the food had to force its way through some raw place. It has proved curative in the habitual colic of children who do not thrive; enlarged mesenteric glands; hungry, but refuse food, swallowing painful. The anus is sore and humid. Piles protrude with urination as well as stool. Constipation, with hard, knotty stools; haemorrhoids, burning and soreness. The paralytic condition appears in the sexual organs. Impotence. Soreness and moistening between scrotum and thighs. Enlarged prostate. There is also a paralytic condition of the respiratory organs. There is a feeling in the larynx as if inspiring smoke or pitch. Hoarseness and loss of voice from cough, mucus in larynx and trachea. Suffocating catarrh and paralysis of lungs in old people. Sensation as if lungs full of smoke. There is a spasmodic cough, like whooping-cough, from roughness and tickling in throat and pit of stomach. Cough B[<] evening till midnight; after getting feet cold; exercise; lying left side; cold air; thinking of it. Palpitation with soreness of heart, B[<] lying on left side; B[<] thinking of it. Violent long lasting palpitation; felt in head. Palpitation B[<] on exertion. Slightest exertion makes him feel tired and sleepy. These heart symptoms of 2[R[Bar-c]] are met with in many cases of aneurism and atheroma, and no remedy has a better record here. I cured an advanced case of thoracic aneurism with the 3x. R[Bar-c] has cured tumours of several kinds. Induration in the breasts. Sarcoma in neck with burning. Fatty tumours, especially about the neck. Swelling and induration of glands. A marked symptom is, pulsation in the back. Stiffness and tension in small of back, in evening, especially while sitting, allowing neither to rise nor to bend backwards. Painfulness of arms and swelling of axillary glands. Cold feet. Fetid perspiration of feet. Corns with burning and stinging. Burning and drawing pains are frequent in lower limbs. A case has been recorded in which R[Bar-c] removed in an old man a pain, coming suddenly, in hollow of knee and running down back of leg like a thin stream of hot fluid or molten metal, running down under the skin. Tearing in limbs with chilliness. Tension and shortening of muscles. Intolerable irritation all over like prickings and tingling, waking him at night. Itching, sore and humid skins.} S{Warts.} S{Burning pains are found in many parts. General soreness and sensitiveness. Small wounds ulcerate and get very sore.} S{Chilliness predominates. It has cold, clammy feet as notably as R[Calc] B[<] Cold air; cold washing; damp weather; warm food; in sun (headache); near warm stove (headache). B[<] From raising arms, B[<] from mental emotion. B[<] Thinking of complaints. B[<] In company; B[>] alone. B[>] From cold food. Left side much affected. Offensive sweat of one side (mostly left). B[<] Lying on painful side; on left side. B[<] After eating. After eating, so weak cannot raise his hands; too weak to masticate.}
