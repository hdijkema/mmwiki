:rubric=Characteristics.
S{Carbolic acid, like the Carbons, is a powerful antiseptic, and its use as such in surgery has led incidentally to the poisoning of both patients and surgeons. These experiences have provided a number of the symptoms indicating its medicinal use. The pains of carbolic acid come suddenly. They are burning and pricking, sticking. The urine is very dark, black or blackish olive-green; grass or olive-green. There is numbness and twitching. Putrid discharges are a marked indication. The skin is inflamed, and other symptoms appear, with burning, tingling, itching, and numbness. Gangrene has been caused by the application of 2 to 5 per cent. solutions. There is profound prostration and fatigue; convulsions; collapse; cold, clammy sweat. Constant yawning. R. K. Ghosh finds it admirable in cases (if cholera where 2[R[verat]] seems indicated and fails. There is intolerance of warm room; but also sensitiveness to cold air which B[<] many symptoms. Many poisoning cases show pneumonia, single or double, affecting the bases principally. Dr. Proctor has recorded a brilliant cure of a double basal pneumonia with drop doses of the B. P. solution, after failure of more commonly used remedies. Nervous dyspepsia of intensely painful character has frequently been cured by it; and R. K. Ghosh has reported great improvement in a case of diabetes when the remedy was given for something else. Proell has recorded his own case of idiopathic erysipelas affecting the back of the right hand, first three fingers and arm, with violet-coloured swelling and roughness. R[Rhus-t] removed the fever, but did nothing to stop the erysipelas. This R[Carb-ac] 30 did promptly. It was prescribed by Dr. Streintz. Fahnestock reports a case of poisoning observed by himself from inhaling the fumes. The patient, a woman, feeling ill, ran across the street to a neighbour's. Before reaching the house she fell prostrate, pale, gasping for breath. When taken in, she had to be propped up in order to breathe; trembled all over; wanted her hands held; "pricking like needles," all over body; unable to raise right arm. Cold hands and feet. Wanted a drink of water every few minutes; nausea but no vomiting; pain in lumbar region. Symptoms lasted four hours. It has been used with success in the vomiting of drunkards; of pregnant women with violent frontal headache. Great flatulent distension of the abdomen, with belching of wind and desire for stimulants, indicates the drug. Palpitation of the heart at night has been cured by it. It has relieved cases of cancer of the stomach, and has apparently cured epithelioma of the cheek and nose, with haemorrhages (Allen). Deschere has found R[Carb-ac] 30 of great service in uterine displacements, with or without discharges, but these, if present, are 2[always offensive.] The symptoms first relieved are the agonising backache across the loins with a dragging sensation down the buttocks into the thighs. Cooper regards it as specific in influenza, in the 3x for the attack, and 30th for resulting debility.}
