:rubric=Characteristics.
S{R[Cina] is the source of the alkaloid R[Santin]. It is pre-eminently a worm medicine, as it causes all the symptoms which characterise helminthiasis both mental, nervous, and bodily. It corresponds more to the effects of lumbrici than to those of other worms. There is irritation of the nose, causing constant desire to rub, prick, or press into it. In children there is extreme ill-humour and naughtiness. Nothing pleases them for any length of time; gritting teeth during sleep; wetting the bed (when accompanied by picking nose, great hunger, restless sleep); tossing all about the bed in sleep; crying out as if in delirium Sherbino has found "getting on hands and knees in sleep" a strong indication for it. But R[Cina] is much more than a mere worm-medicine. Many symptoms appear to be reflex from abdominal irritation. A characteristic feature is: Extreme sensitiveness of mind and body: offended by the slightest thing; peevish and obstinate; aversion to be caressed. Over-sensitiveness of surface: cannot endure to be approached, touched, or pressed upon; touch induces or aggravates spasms. Child cannot bear to have head combed or brushed. Aversion to light. Strabismus; with sickly look and dark circles round eyes; yellow vision. Asthenopia, defective accommodation; yellow vision. Ravenous hunger; sinking immediately after a meal. Difficult swallowing of liquids; clucking noise from throat to stomach. Nocturnal enuresis; urine white, turbid, at times fetid. Larynx extremely sensitive, touching it causes suffocative spasm. Cough excited by sensation of feather down in throat. Reflex cough; caused by writing or reading (to oneself). In fever there is thirst with chill; face pale and cold; hands warm; nausea or vomiting of bile or ingesta. Charles Mohr (2[H. M.], January, 1898) commends it for: anaemic persons suffering from indigestion and non-assimilation of food; or after acute illness when they have headache, vertigo, and neuralgia. In the cachectic who have pains in the belly and deranged abdominal functions, and suffer nervously. For asthenopia from onanism, when reading by artificial light is next to impossible; eyes feel veiled, need constant wiping. Spasmodic strabismus from abdominal irritation. Spasmodic asthma after food that disagrees, "sensation as if sternum lies too close to back, embarrasses breathing and causes anxiety and sweat." Prosopalgia of supra- and infra-orbital region and zygoma chiefly, pains pressing, screwing, with hyperaesthesia. Gastralgia, enteralgia, and fevers when the leading symptoms are present. Nash (2[Leaders in Typhoid Fever]) mentions two cases of typhoid in which Cina proved curative, the indications being "Intense 2[circumscribed redness of the cheeks], and frequent and 2[violent rubbing of the nose.]" S. C. Ghose has recorded (2[H. W.], September, 1899) a striking cure by R[Cina] 6 and 200 of a case of infantile remittent fever, in which the classical symptoms of the drug were present; the fever came on very irregularly. The symptoms of R[Cina] are B[<] night; before midnight child wakes up frightened. B[<] From open air; cold air; cold water. B[<] Yawning. Child lies on belly, or on hands and knees, during sleep. Guernsey says R[Cina] is suited to complaints which are concomitant to yawning, which come on whenever one yawns.}
