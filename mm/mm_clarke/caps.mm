:rubric=Characteristics.
S{I[Capsicum] should be studied in connection with the other great members of the Solanum family, R[Bell], R[Stram], R[Hyos], R[Dulc], R[Sol-c], R[Sol-n], R[Sol-t] (Potato), and R[Lycpr] (Tomato). It acts with great intensity on the mucous membranes, and also on the bones: affections of bones in general; pains in bones of face; inflammation of petrous bone. R[Caps] corresponds especially to persons of light hair and blue eyes; also to persons of lax fibre and muscles; obesity; lazy, fat, unclean persons who dread the open air; clumsy children; awkward persons; haemorrhoidal troubles. Lack of reaction and bodily irritability. Symptoms generally appear on left side. As with R[Dulc], there is extreme sensitiveness to cold and damp which B[<] most symptoms. The well-known burning effects of red pepper is a leading indication for its use Burning pains" wherever occurring demand that R[Caps] should have the first consideration, if there are no other determining symptoms in favour of another remedy. The burning of R[caps]. is B[<] from cold water. Redness of the skin, and even a scarlet eruption like R[Bell]. Very characteristic is a cough with fetid breath, or bad taste. Cough causing splitting pain in head. Chill at 10.30 a.m., beginning between shoulders and running down back. A case of poisoning in a worker in a capsicum-plaister factory brought out: severe chill with shaking; and it ended in an intense coryza. R[caps]. 30 brought speedy relief in a case of tympanites following laparotomy, the concomitant symptoms being: cold nose and extremities, and cyanosis. R[caps]. is a notable fever remedy. The patient is thirsty} S{but drinking causes shuddering. Absence of thirst during heat. Burning, pungent pains, B[<] by application of cold water, are very marked. Burning, pungent sensation in face B[<] by slightest draught of cold air; burning in throat; burning blisters in roof of mouth (diphtheria or gangrene); constriction of throat, spasmodic closure, pain when not swallowing; burning in rectum, tenesmus, haemorrhage; burning on urination; burning in bladder. R[caps]. is among the remedies of the front rank in stomatitis in inflammation of the middle ear, with involvement of mastoid cells in the sore throat of smokers and drinkers, with inflammation, burning, relaxed uvula, sometimes dry, sometimes with tough mucus difficult to dislodge. Local burning and general chilliness distinguish R[caps]. in a vast number of cases. R[caps]. is indicated where there is lack of reaction in persons of lax fibre. The mental state shows home-sickness. "Home-sickness, with red cheeks and sleeplessness; with hot feeling in fauces." (With a few doses of R[caps]. I cured completely an Australian girl, of florid complexion, who had come to London to study, and who was quite incapacitated by home-sickness.) There is awkwardness, fearfulness, obstinacy. Alternating states; laughs and weeps by turns; is now jocose and sings, but becomes angry from slightest cause. Delirium: it has been given with great success in delirium tremens, mostly in drachm doses of the tincture, given in milk. B[>] From heat is the most important modality. Patients who cannot get to sleep without a hot bottle at their back. Rest B[<] some forms of headache and B[>] others. Motion 2[=] headache as if skull would split; as if bruised; asthma; chilliness; stiff joints to crack. Ascending 2[=] asthma. B[<] By touch. Shuns open air; dreads uncovering; dreads air, especially a draught. Spirits become lower as body becomes cooler. Sensation as if cayenne pepper were sprinkled on parts. Violent pains in various places; now here now there. Sensation as if parts would go to sleep. I had one patient on whom R[caps]. acted well in summer, but not in winter. Equal parts of tincture of R[caps]. and glycerine make an excellent liniment for external use in many cases of chronic rheumatism and neuralgia.}
