:rubric=Characteristics.
S{R[Cast] resembles 2[R[Ambr], R[Mosch], R[Ign]], and R[Valer]. It is suited to nervous women, with pains, cramps, weakness after severe illness; hysterical individuals; abdominal soreness; nervous attacks when the aura starts from abdomen. The pains are B[>] by pressure. Menstrual colic, with pallor and cold sweat. Prostration is a leading feature in the effects of the drug. There is also a feeling of fulness in the stomach as if too much had been eaten.} S{R[Cast] when fresh is yellow and of the consistence of syrup when dry it is dark red or brown and of the consistence of hard wax. Teste remarks that it has been regarded as a resinous substance, and he observes, moreover, that the beaver feeds almost entirely on the resinous bark of pine-trees. In Siberia beavers feed on the bark of the birch, which may make a difference in the effects of R[Cast] from different countries. Caspari proved Russian R[Cast], Nenning that of Southern Europe. Teste concluded from analogy that R[Cast] would be an antisycotic, and he proved his point by initiating with it the cure of a case of pedunculated vegetations around the anus in a hysterical young woman. R[Thuj] completed the cure. Teste places R[Cast] in the R[Thuj] group with R[plat]. and R[bism]. He quotes from Trousseau and Pideux the following indications, which he confirms:} S{(2[1]) "Amenorrhoea, accompanied with painful and tympanitic swelling of the abdomen. We mean the cases where only a few drops of blood escape from the uterus, with a sort of 2[uterine tenesmus.]" (2[2]) "The cases of colic to which R[Cast] seems to be principally adapted are of the nervous kind, that seem to be particularly seated in the small intestine. They are accompanied with paleness and cold sweats, a sudden sinking of strength, as if the very principle of life had been struck down. They are without any alvine evacuations, come suddenly, after lively emotions, a cold on the bowels or by the feet, as after long exposure to a cold rain; they constitute a sort of that passion termed by authors 2[miserere.]" R[Cast] causes jerking in small groups of muscular fibres; a sensation of heaviness of whole body; trembling of limbs.}
