:rubric=Characteristics.
S{This salt has been proved by A. R. Barrett and a friend, who each took one grain of 2x trit. The following are the chief symptoms it caused: Dull, heavy pressure from whole top of head between frontal and occipital bones; pain generally increased with increasing depression. Great fulness and oppression round heart, fulness throughout thorax and head; veins of upper parts and upper extremities stand out like whipcords. Dyspnoea; must have air. Profuse sweat all over. Complete loss of muscular power with loss of desire to move. Pallor of skin. With the first trituration Nash cured a boy of eight who had several abscesses in and around the knee-joint. The tibia was ulcerated, and the ragged edge of the bone protruded through the surface. There was emaciation, loss of appetite, and he was as pale as a corpse. The appetite returned at once in great force.}
