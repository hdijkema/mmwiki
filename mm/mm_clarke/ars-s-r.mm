:rubric=Characteristics.
S{The Red Sulphide of Arsenic was introduced and proved by Neidhard, but it has been used somewhat empirically on indications borrowed from its two components. T. N. McLaughlin has reported much success in skin cases, especially in cases of psoriasis, and also of eczema, acne, and furuncles. He gave it in tablets of 2x trit., and found patients who could not tolerate R[Ars] could take R[Ars-s-r] without any unpleasant symptoms, and with marked curative effect. There was no gastric or intestinal irritation in any of his cases. The provings brought out some characteristic features. J. Meredith cured, with R[Ars-s-r] mainly, a young girl who suffered from an occipital headache; profuse, repulsive, nauseating nasal catarrh; leucorrhoea, pelvic pains, menstrual troubles, and general anaemic appearance. I have found it useful in many cases of influenza and its sequelae, especially sciatica. Burning pains (as if coals of fire in stomach, B[<] drinking cold water). External heat. Bone pains. All symptoms B[<] at night. B[<] On waking (headache). Chilly even before a hot stove. Restless sleep with very vivid dreams. Convulsions. Itching in various parts. Numbness.}
