:rubric=Characteristics.
S{I[Anacardium] has many features in common with its botanical relatives, the different species of R[Rhus-t], especially in its action on the skin, muscles, and joints, but it has also very distinct features of its own. A very characteristic sensation is a pressing or penetrating pain as from a 2[plug], which may occur in any locality in connection with neuralgias and ear affection, piles, etc., and whenever present R[Anac] will probably be the remedy. Sensation of a hoop or band around the body or about any part is a leading symptom. It has been used with success in diseases of the spinal cord with this sensation and the feeling of a plug in the spine, B[<] by any motion which causes a pain as if the plug were sticking still further in. Paralysed feeling in knees. Sensation as if knees were bandaged}

S{The nut is heart-shaped (hence its name), and perhaps this may be taken as the "sign" of its courage-imparting properties. It has at any rate won for itself a reputation in "examination funk" and allied conditions. Brain-fag. Loss of memory is very marked. Deafness with loss of memory. Headache B[<] by mental exertion; B[>] by eating. The R[Anac] patient has many mental aberrations; is clairaudient, hearing voices of persons far away, or dead; voices behind her. Seems to have two wills. Is as if in a dream. A curious symptom is a great propensity to swear and blaspheme in persons not usually addicted thereto. Irritability. There is also a tendency to suicide by shooting (R[Ant-c]). Fixed ideas of various kinds: that mind and body are separated; that he is double; that a demon sits on his neck telling him most offensive things; that he sees everybody's face in a glass except his own. The senses are either too weak or too acute, and there ire sense illusions: a light has a halo; optical illusions in dark colours; illusions of hearing; illusions of smell: burning tinder, pigeon's dung. I cured with it a man who had a smell of burning wood in his nose, remaining after influenza. There is a headache proceeding from before backward. Stiffness in nape of neck. Stiff-neck B[<] beginning to move. Whooping-cough with gaping and drowsiness after the cough. Morning sickness of pregnancy B[>] by eating, but returns soon after. The R[Anac] indigestion contrasts with that of R[Nux-v] in a striking way. With R[Nux-v] the pain is worst for two or three hours after a meal, 2[during] stomach-digestion, and is B[>] when that is over; whereas with R[Anac] it is just then (when digestion is complete) that the pain is worst, and it lasts until the next meal, which again B[>] for a time}

S{E. S. Breyfogle narrates a striking case (an involuntary proving illustrating the nerve and skin effects of the remedy. Acting on Bayes' indications, "funk before examination," "nerve-exhaustion from over-study," "nervous prostration from seminal emissions," or sexual excess, Breyfogle had used the remedy with much success. To a patient, for excessive nervousness, he gave the 1st dilution in discs. He took two discs every four hours till eight were taken. Then a sore mouth suddenly developed, mucous membrane inflamed, burning, and acutely sensitive. Vesicles appeared on roof of mouth, and a dirty membrane peeled off easily. Gums were next affected. Mouth dry, taste offensive: at the same time a papular eruption on wrists and ankles, later on inside-arms and legs, chest, neck, back, especially defined in bends of knees and elbows, and worst of all about anus. Scratching B[<] but was compelled to scratch all the same. Water as 2[hot] as could be borne B[>] instantly. Simultaneously the nervousness disappeared. "I haven't had a nerve since. It has made a profound impression on my nervous system." Later came a sudden sense of complete prostration: knees gave way; had to keep a flask of whisky by him to relieve it. Later: cold chills ran over body at least exposure, even putting arms out of bed; feared he was going to be ill, slept with hot bottles on chest all night. As eruption in mouth disappeared salivary flow increased; it ran from his mouth on pillow during sleep. "Feels as if a particle of food were in œsophagus; swallows constantly to get rid of it.}

S{There is not the same B[<] by rest and B[>] by motion as with R[Rhus-t], but many symptoms are B[<] by commencing motion (stiff-neck). Headache is B[>] lying down. Piano-playing caused heaviness and fulness of the whole body. Like R[Rhus-t], R[Anac] has chilliness, liability to take cold, sensitiveness to draughts, and B[>] from warmth. The symptoms are B[<] morning, and again evening to midnight. 4 p.m.: heat daily. The cough of R[Anac] is B[>] by eating. Symptoms generally B[>] by eating; recur two hours after}

S{There is intermittence in the symptoms of R[Anac] "The attacks ceased for one or two days, and then continued again for a couple of days." Guided by this indication alone, Custis cured with R[Anac] 200 a case of sleeplessness in a pregnant woman: "Spells of sleeplessness lasting for several nights." R[Anac] is suited to affections of the palms of the hands. There are warts even on the palms}
