:rubric=Characteristics.
R[cupr-acet]. produces the leading features of R[cupr]: S{cramps, griping pains, spasms, paralytic affections, and convulsions}. S{Attacks come on suddenly and periodically.} S{It corresponds to the results of repelled eruptions.} 

Dr. Burnett has cured with it a case of left-sided brow ague of many years' standing. He used Rhademacher's I[Tincture of Copper]. S{The pain was described as boring, screwing and was spoken of by the patient as "awful."} Dr. Burnett is unable to say whether the cure was strictly homoeopathic or "whether the I[Cuprum] acted on the basis of the Paracelsic Universalia of which it is one." 

A man, 50, was cured with R[Cupr-acet] 5 trit. of a S{tonic spasm of the toes of the right foot, very painful, lasting for hours, brought on by friction, standing on cold floors, etc.} There was no traceable cause, and no other derangement of health. Complete cure in five days, after months of previous suffering (I[H. R.], ii. 71). 

Petroz recommended its use in S{small-pox} and verified his induction in practice. 

As pointed out by General Phelps (I[H. W.], October, 1896), the "Crimson Cross Ointment" used successfully by Fielden in the Gloucester epidemic of small-pox owes its virtues to the R[cupr-acet]. which it contains. 

S{In epilepsy the aura begins in the knees and ascends to hypogastrium, when patient becomes insensible.} S{The symptoms are B[<] by heat and by motion.} S{The patient frequently changes, posture.} S{It is suited to the carbo-nitrogenous constitution.}
