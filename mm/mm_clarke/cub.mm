Nash defines its place in gonorrhoea thus: "After the inflammatory stage is passed under the usual remedies for that stage, if there still remains burning in the urethra after micturition, and the discharge remains thick, yellow, or pus-like (with R[puls] the discharge is 2[bland]; with R[merc]. all symptoms are B[<] at night). Thin (gleety) discharge does not correspond to any of the three."
