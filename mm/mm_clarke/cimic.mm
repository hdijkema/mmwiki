:rubric=Characteristics.
One of the most marked symptoms of R[Cimic]  is found in the mental sphere: S{a sense of gloom and dejection, as if there was a black pall over everything; showing the appropriateness of the remedy in hysteria and hypochondriasis.} 
S{There is also fear of death, as with R[acon].} 
S{Incessant talking, changing from one subject to another, as in delirium tremens.} 
S{I have greatly relieved an inveterate case of epilepsy in which the aura was a "waving sensation in the brain," which is a leading symptom of the remedy.} 
S{Many symptoms appear in the head and eyes.} S{Feeling as if going crazy with headache.} S{Headache reflected from pelvic organs.} S{The headache is frontal, vertical, or occipital, and is accompanied by great pain in eyeballs B[>] pressure; B[<] slightest motion.} 

I[Peculiar sensations] are: 
S{as of lifting up of skull; as if top of head would fly off; as of a bolt through from base of skull to vertex.} 
S{Inspired air seems to penetrate skull and into brain, causing a cold sensation.} 
S{Intense pain in and around eyes (lancinating), B[<] moving head or eyes.} 

S{In cases of tinnitus aurium it has proved curative in old-school practice, in 15 to 30 drops of the tincture, whether due to direct or reflex irritation (I[L'Art Méd]. , July, 1898).} 

S{In the face there is malar neuralgia, ceasing at night.} 

S{There are many symptoms of 2[disordered digestion, bad] taste and breath and coated tongue; sticky saliva, viscid mucus in throat.} 
S{Sinking at epigastrium is very marked.} 

S{The generative organs in the female are particularly affected by R[Cimic].} 
S{Uterine and ovarian pains are very marked.} S{Infra-mammary pains.} S{Tenderness of uterine region.} S{Pains fly across hypogastrium, extending from one side to the other.} S{Painful and irregular menstruation.} S{Leucorrhoea, with feeling of weight in uterus.} S{Labour-like pains.} S{Left ovarian pains.} S{Given before term it renders labours easier; cures sickness of pregnancy, and prevents after-pains and over-sensitiveness.} 

According to Lippe a characteristic indication is: 

S{"The recently delivered uterus becomes actually jammed in the pelvis with great pain."} 

S{Puerperal mania has been cured by it. It has also ensured living births in women who have previously borne only dead children, from no discoverable cause, given in daily doses I[of 1x for two] months before term.} 

S{In the respiratory sphere a dry, teasing cough, B[<] at night, and B[<] on every attempt to speak, is the most characteristic feature.} S{The rheumatic action of the drug is shown in chest and heart pains and pains in the joints and limbs.} 

S{I have found a pain at the nape of the neck very characteristic.} S{Rheumatism affecting the vertebral joints and especially in the neck.} S{Cerebro-spinal meningitis; head and neck retracted.} 

S{There are sharp pains in chest, especially in heart region and down left arm, which is numb (R[acon]., R[Puls]. R[Rhus-t]) as if bound to the side.} S{Palpitation from least motion.} S{Heart ceases suddenly.}

S{The pains of R[cimic]. are like electric shocks here and there: sharp, lancinating in various parts; chest and uterine pains shoot from side to side.} 

:rubric=Modalities
