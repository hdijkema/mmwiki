:rubric=Characteristics.
S{R[Cocc] has been used from ancient times as a poison for stupefying fish, and making them easy to catch. Correspondingly we find it produces great disturbance of the sensorium in human beings, and all the symptoms of intoxication. It is commonly used as an adulteration of beer to heighten its intoxicating properties. A very characteristic symptom is a sensation of hollowness or emptiness in the head or other parts. Allied to this is a sense of lightness of body. Another characteristic is an opening and shutting sensation, especially in the occiput. Along with the vertigo is nausea and vomiting which bring it into close relation with sea-sickness and carriage-sickness. R[cocc]. corresponds perfectly to the sensitive condition caused by loss of sleep and night-watching, and is the first remedy to think of for removing this. "Irritable weakness" is a leading note in the R[Cocc] effects. The R[Cocc] patient is very sensitive to fear, anger, grief, and all mental disturbances; also to noise and touch. Enlargement of liver after anger. Easily startled. Fear of ghosts and spectres. Stinging pains, stitches, constriction; in the hands a pithy feeling. Many symptoms are B[<] at menstrual period; piles during menses. R[Cocc] has cured a case of delirium at onset of menses during first and second days; the patient said, "I always see something alive, on wall, floor, chairs, or anywhere, always 2[rolling], and will roll on me." R[Cocc] is suited to persons of mild and sluggish temperament; light-haired persons; hypochondriacal, timid, fearful, and nervous persons. Other prominent features of R[cocc]. are: Paralytic pains, or pains as of dislocation. Paralytic weakness; lax-muscles. "Weakness of neck muscles with heaviness of head." Sensation as if single parts had gone to sleep. Immovability of parts affected. Of localities, the right hypochondrium (especially liver), inner hypogastrium, inner forehead, back, upper arm, and bones of arm are chiefly affected. This has been verified: "Spasmodic, flatulent colic, about midnight, flatus passed without relief," recurring several nights; promptly cured by R[cocc]. 3x. Lippe cured a case of enlargement of the liver after parturition, the indication being "the liver was more painful after anger." The sensitiveness to touch is very great and serves to indicate R[Cocc] in preference to other remedies in many affections where this is pronounced, in articular rheumatism, in ulcers, in neuralgic affections of bones. The least jar is unbearable (travelling by land or sea). B[<] By touch, pressure, or jar. B[<] From motion generally; moving body; rising from bed; bending over or stooping. B[<] Kneeling; walking; swallowing saliva. Sitting B[>] some symptoms. Many symptoms are B[<] evening and night, especially about midnight and 1 a.m. Sensitive to air either hot or cold. Longs for cold drinks, but eating or drinking anything cold 2[=] tearing in limbs. B[<] Open air. B[<] From sun. B[<] By warmth of bed. B[>] In a room. A decoction of Cocculus is a domestic remedy used locally for destroying head- or body-lice.}
