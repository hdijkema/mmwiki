:rubric=Characteristics.
There are three main symptoms in the Digitalis pathogenesis which should be borne in mind: 
1 S{Slow, weak, irregular and intermittent pulse.} 
1 S{Enlarged, sore, painful liver.} 
1 S{White, pasty stools.} 
S{Along with these is prostration from slight exertion.} 

S{The mental condition is: anxious; low-spirited; tearful, wants to be alone; tries to escape if others force themselves on her.} 
S{Anxiety as if conscience-troubled.} 
S{"Anxious and concentrated sadness, with sleeplessness at night, owing to pains at the heart: for instance, from unhappy love, especially in women of brown complexions, firm and obstinate dispositions. In such cases far preferable to R[Ign]" (Teste).} 

Teste classes R[dig]. with R[bry] and R[Ign].  

S{The stomach symptoms (from portal engorgement) are nausea and vomiting; the mere sight or smell of food excites violent nausea, with clean tongue, thirst for water, absence of fever; the complaints may come either from excessive venery or from high living.} 

S{In old men there are: enlarged prostate; impotence; lascivious thoughts.} 

* I[Malcolm Macfarlan] (2[H. P.], xiii. 490) reports R[dig]. having produced S{severe urethritis, phimosis, and strangury.} S{He has cured with it many cases of gonorrhoea.} 
* S{I[Ballard] cured a man of headache and dizziness originating probably in gonorrhoea suppressed several years before.} S{He complained of feeling bad about the head after drinking}, and this keynote symptom was elicited: "S{after drinking cold water the pain would seat itself in the forehead and extend down the nose.}" S{Delirium tremens in high livers, stomach and liver diseases with the mental state of the drug.} S{Nausea B[<] from smell of food; not B[>] by vomiting.} S{The food eaten comes up by mouthfuls, cannot expectorate without vomiting.} S{Every shock, like bad news strikes her in the epigastrium.} S{Deathly sinking in the epigastrium.} 
* S{The use of R[dig] as a remedy for pneumonia in the old school is well known.} S{It has proved a very dangerous remedy, but it has been used by homoeopaths with very good effect in senile pneumonia (E. V. Ross., 2[H. P.], xvii. 177).} Ross regards the indications as being: "S{Dry cough with mucous r√¢les and no expectoration or only 'prune-juice' expectoration; cyanosis, cold extremities; feeble, intermittent pulse deathly nausea or gone sensation at epigastrium}." 

S{Restlessness with great nervous weakness.} S{Lassitude, mental and bodily.} S{Faintness. Convulsions, with retraction of head, syncope, and collapse.} 

Among the peculiar sensations of R[dig]. are: 
S{Sensation as if the heart would stand still if he moved, must hold the breath and keep still (R[gels]. has "must keep moving or the heart would stop.")} S{As if the brain were loose; as if something fell forward in the head on stooping; as if the brain were made of fine glass and shattered at a blow; as if something were running out of urethra; as of a weight attached to stomach; as if the internal parts were grown together.} 
S{As if the lungs were constricted and tied up in bundles.} S{As if heart stood still; as if heart had torn itself loose and were swaying to and fro by a thin thread; as if the stomach would sink into abdomen.} S{Terrible pain at root of nose after vomiting.} 

S{Discharged blood coagulates slowly or not at all.} S{Distended veins in eyes, ears, lips, and tongue.} S{Blue skin.} 
S{R[dig] is suited to the climacteric period: sudden flushes of heat followed by great debility; least motion B[=] palpitation.} S{Nervous lymphatic constitutions.} S{Children with very white complexions, light hair, scrofulous.}
