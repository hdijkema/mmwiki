:rubric=Characteristics.
S{Red coral, the product of a coralligene zoophyte, contains carbonate of lime, oxide of iron (whence its colour), gelatin, and other elements. In old physic it was considered to have "strengthening properties," and to be astringent, sudorific, diuretic, and absorbent. In homoeopathic practice 2[Corallium] corresponds to a combination of syphilis and psora. Is suited to persons of nervous temperament; nervous coughs. It causes eruptions which are for the most part of its own colour, coral-red. Red spots on the palms of the hands, at first coral colour, then darker, and finally coppery. The chancres to which it corresponds are coral-red. The cough is of the whooping-cough type; smothering sensation before, and great exhaustion after cough. Cough in "minute-gun" paroxysms. Crowing inspiration; sensation as if inspired air was icy cold. There is much drowsiness with R[cor-r]., and many symptoms appear during sleep. J. N. Lowe cured with R[cor-r]. an infant, almost a year old, suffering from laryngismus stridulus, the indications being B[<] during sleep and after waking. R[lach]., given first, failed to relieve. Guernsey's indication is: "Whooping-cough, or any other kind of cough when the attack comes on, with a 2[very] rapid cough, and the attacks follow so closely as to almost run into each other." I have found it most effective in the nervous "minute-gun" cough where the patient gives an isolated cough at regular intervals through the day. Nash finds it the most useful of all remedies in post-nasal catarrh. Guernsey's other indication is: "Red, flat ulcers on the glans and inner surface of the prepuce, with secretion of a quantity of yellow ichor." In the head there is a sensation of emptiness or hollowness. Head feels very large. Sensation as if forehead were flattened. Change of air causes coughing. Feels cold when uncovered and too hot when covered.}
