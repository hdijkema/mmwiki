S{To Rademacher we are principally indebted for this remedy. It is with him primarily an hepatic: all its manifestations originating in some disorder of the liver. According to Burnett the greatest effect of R[card-m]. is felt on the spleen and liver, especially the splenic end of the liver. G. F. Laidlaw (2[H. M.], xxxiv. 686) gives a condensed translation of Rademacher's remarks about 2[R[card-m].:] He regards haematemesis as most frequently due to chronic disease of the spleen; less frequently to disease of the liver. People who have long suffered from pains in left hypochondrium are apt to vomit blood, after which they are relieved. Rademacher regards the bleeding as often beneficial, and says it should not be checked too soon. In the treatment of haematemesis he says it is best to use a remedy that acts on the epigastric region without irritating the stomach and interfering with the healing of the lesion. Such a remedy he found in a decoction of the seeds of R[card-m]. He used to give R[op] before, but this, he says, in some people "produces an array of symptoms similar to those seen in severe haemorrhage, and might aggravate the condition." He adds: "It is probable that many small haemorrhages of the stomach escape notice because there is no vomiting, and that it is in this manner that obscure abdominal complaints are sometimes suddenly relieved or cured."} S{The liver enlargement of R[card-m]. is in the 2[transverse] direction (that of R[chel]. being more vertical). Burnett relates the case of a girl of sixteen who had had severe attacks of vomiting for three months, with pains in abdomen. The vomiting was relieved by remedies symptomatically related, but the pains were not. An examination showed "liver and spleen both very much enlarged so that they seem to fill the abdomen." R[card-m]. Ã˜ gtt. v. night and morning soon cured the patient. Dudgeon has given an account of Windelband's and Kunze's experience with the remedy. Windelband in treating a woman for chronic swelling of the liver with R[card-m]., incidentally cured at the same time some "colossal" varicose ulcers. This experience led him to cure a large number of like cases with the same remedy. He also cured gastro-intestinal catarrh; epistaxis; metrorrhagia; haemorrhoidal flux; dependent on portal congestion. Tenderness of the liver; bilious fever; symptoms resembling peritonitis and stitch-in-the-side have been cured by it. Kunze commends the remedy, in addition, in cases of spasm of the stomach, pains contractive, vomiting occurring at the climax, cold rising from precordium to throat; feeling of spasmodic constriction; pressive, shooting pain right side of abdomen spreading to back or shoulder. He has cured with it pains in hepatic and splenic regions accompanied with haemoptysis, or expectoration of viscid, lumpy mucus, and evening fever. Even phthisis pituitosa has been cured by it. Local muscular rheumatisms dependent on liver disease. E. A. Cook (formerly of Richmond) gave R[card-m]. 1 to a patient suffering from liver congestion, swollen veins of legs, piles, and headache, with great benefit to all the symptoms. On the second day the patient developed these new symptoms, which she had never had before and which alarmed her greatly: "Great giddiness with inclination to fall forward; and a sudden and profuse epistaxis followed by great relief." A striking cure by R[card-m]. in "Miner's Disease" is recorded by Proell.: An old miner in the gold mines of Bockstein suffered from the so-called "Bergsucht" (miner's disease). "His chief symptoms were: earthy complexion, eyes dim, hardness of hearing, mucous coating on tongue, loss of appetite even for his favourite food and tobacco; great dyspnoea and palpitation on going up-hill; spleen and stomach distended; much wind eructated, constant borborygmus, constipation alternating with diarrhoea, but the latter more frequent, evacuations grey, urine scanty and pale, skin dry as if withered, great weakness, pulse slow and weak. Especially remarkable was the disposition of this man. Formerly cheerful, he is now joyless and apathetic; the most important events he took no notice of, I gave him tinct. R[card-m]., a few drops four times a day. I was unable to effect any alteration in his food, drink, or regimen. A month after this he returned looking much better. On asking him how he was, he replied: "You have made a new man of me." Almost all the former symptoms had disappeared and given place to the opposite. His complexion was fresh, his eyes sparkled, he was cheerful, wished to live and work, had good appetite, motions brown, more urine passed, pulse normal. He said he now for the first time knew what it was to be well, and he remained so for many years." (I[Zeit., Berl. Verl. Amer. Hom.], December 15, 1895) Proell also recommends it in affections of liver, spleen, and kidneys caused by abuse of alcoholic beverages and especially beer. He relates two cases: one in a cook who had symptoms of cirrhosis of the liver and general dropsy which made her features unrecognisable; and one in a worker in a brewery who developed dropsy. Both were cured by the tincture. The brewery man, thinking the remedy was intended to be purgative, and thinking the 4 drops prescribed would not be sufficient, took the whole amount, 2 1/2 drachms, at one dose, without markedly bad effects, and was quickly cured. Proell adds that R[card-m]. is indicated where there is a relaxed state of the mucous membrane of the stomach as evidenced by flatulence and diarrhoea, especially when the stools are clay-coloured. Much fatigue is experienced, B[<] after eating; when riding; on awaking; frequently accompanied by yawning. Chilliness is prominent, on awaking; at night; B[<] uncovering. Coldness of knees. Head very sensitive to cold. Sweating of forehead and back after meals. Stitches, drawing pressure are prominent among the sensations, also radiating pains; constriction, band-sensation and cramps. Motion B[<] most complaints.}
