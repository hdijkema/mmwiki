GT{Camphor. C10 H16 O. - N. O. Lauraceae. A gum obtained from Laurus camphora. Solution in rectified spirit.}


:rubric=Clinical.
S{Angina pectoris. Bed-sores. 2[Cholera Asiatica.] Chordee. 2[Cold.] Convulsions. Epilepsy. 2[Eruptions, suppressed.] Erysipelas. Gonorrhoea. Heart affections. 2[Hyperpyrexia.] Influenza. 2[Measles.

:rubric=Characteristics.
S{"Chill; cramp; convulsion with mental anguish"} S{these give an idea of the essential action of 2[Camphor.] It causes retreat from the circumference to the centre; and its chief remedial action is in correcting just such conditions} S{cold, collapse, repercussed eruptive diseases. "Great coldness of surface, with sudden and complete prostration of the vital forces." Feeling as if a cold wind were blowing over body. In all kinds of sudden internal pains arising from chill, or other causes, 2[Camphor] in rapidly repeated doses will be very likely to prove Curative. In these conditions it is often prescribed on broad indications and given in the lower potencies, but those whose knowledge of 2[Camphor] is confined to its coarser actions will never understand what a great remedy it is when used according to its fine symptomatic indications and given in the higher potencies. R[camph]. produces tetanic spasms, with showing of teeth by drawing up the mouth corners (like 2[Nux] and 2[Phytolacca], but the deathly coldness of R[camph]. distinguishes it from both). R[camph]. has internal heat and external coldness. In the collapse of cholera it corresponds rather to the initial chill before either vomiting or diarrhoea. (The collapse of R[carb-v]. is rather the result of alvine discharges.) The tongue is cold. If he can speak, the voice is either high pitched or husky. The cramps of R[camph]. are less pronounced than in R[cupr].; but cramps with icy coldness of limbs is characteristic of R[camph]. The coldness of R[camph]. resembles that of R[verat]., but with the latter the discharges are copious, and R[camph]. has marked nausea, and the expression of nausea, upper lip drawn up. In some epidemics, R[camph]. given early has alone cured a large majority of the cases treated, and that whether given in drop doses of the tincture or in the 30th. Salzer (2[On Cholera], p. 68) says the cases calling for it are those in which "arterial spasm," with difficult breathing (spasm of pulmonary arteries), coldness and lividity are the leading features. In its actions on the genito-urinary sphere R[camph]. approaches R[canth]. in intensity, and is one of the antidotes to the latter. Strangury and priapism are among its effects. R[camph]. is indicated in many conditions of sudden collapse from overpowering influences acting on the nervous centres. For example, sunstroke: vitality ebbing away; fainting spells growing worse; body icy cold and bathed in cold sweat. Some characteristics are: Most pains are felt during a half-conscious condition, and 2[disappear when thinking of them.] Afraid of his own thoughts; wants to be diverted from thoughts of himself. Fears to be left alone. Memory lost. Great sensitiveness to cold and cold air; which B[<] pains takes cold easily. Surface cold to touch, 2[yet throws off all covering.] Extremities cold, with cramps. Awkwardness. Spasmodic movement of head; head drawn to r. side; rest of body relaxed; unconscious. Spasmodic drawing of head laterally or backwards with deathly coldness. Erysipelas spreading to central membranes. Repercussed eruptions. Soft parts drawn in. Skin painfully sensitive. In the form of the ordinary 2[Camphor] pilules, I have found it an excellent remedy for simple sleeplessness. In this, as in its effect on colds, it resembles R[acon]. Irritable, weakly blondes most affected. Scrofulous children most sensitive to R[camph].}
