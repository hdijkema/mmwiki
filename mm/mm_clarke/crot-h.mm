:rubric=Characteristics.
The first regular proving of R[Crot-h] was made by Hering and under his direction. Stokes also contributed a proving; but the most complete account of the remedy is to be found in the monograph of J. W. Hayward, forming part of I[Materia Medica Physiological and Applied.] This includes provings made by Hayward and his provers.

S{R[Crot-h] produces profound nervous shock and prostration with trembling, mental alienation, and disorganisation of the fluids and tissues.} 
It causes bleeding from all orifices and surfaces, and it corresponds to the haemorrhagic diathesis; to diseases caused by previous low states of system, by zymotic or septic poisoning, by abuse of alcohol, etc. Low, typhoid states, with oppressed nervous system, and degraded blood-supply often require it. Neuralgia occurring as a sequel of septic toxaemic, or even miasmatic disease; or chronic bilious, climateric, or albuminuric conditions. Broken-down constitutions. The R[crot-h]. patient is readily moved to tears. Weeping mood; agony, despair. In one prover perception was so clouded that she was in danger of being run over in the street; and memory was so impaired that on entering a shop she forgot what she had come for. Sleepy, but cannot sleep. Grinds teeth. "R[crot-h]. is preferable in fluid haemorrhages, yellow skin (hence in yellow fever with black vomit), epistaxis of diphtheria. R[Naja] has more nervous phenomena. R[lach]. has skin cold-clammy rather than cold and dry; haemorrhage, with charred-straw sediment; and more markedly ailments of the left side. R[Elaps] is preferable in otorrhoea and in affections of the right lung. The cobra poison (R[Naja]) coagulates blood into long strings. R[Crot-h] poison is acid; the R[Viper] neutral. The Rotton-snake !["Birri"] causes more sloughing than any other" (Hering). But Hayward observed that sloughing is a strong indication for R[crot-h]., and the cure by this remedy of his own daughter of scarlatina maligna, with gangrenous-looking sore-throat, was a dramatic outcome of his researches. 

:div-begin=quote
A case of rattle-snake bite and its isopathic cure, related by Dr. J. S. M. Chaffee, in I[Hom. News], Sept., 1892, gives a good general idea of the action of the venom: "I was called to see James Wright, aged 54 years, who, while binding wheat, was bitten on third finger of right hand by a rattlesnake. I found him bleeding from the bitten finger, and from eyes, nose, ears, mouth, rectum and urethra; pulse 110, small, wiry; respiration 40; temperature 105; haggard expression; whole body bathed in hot perspiration; delirium. This patient had had the regular routine treatment of whisky, quinine and carbonate ammonia for ninety-six hours, when the attendants withdrew and pronounced the case beyond the reach of medical aid. S{A marked characteristic symptom was a 2[mouldy smell of breath], with scarlet red tongue, and difficult swallowing.} S{Great sensitiveness of skin of 2[right half] of body, so much so that the slightest touch would produce twitching of muscles of that side.} I prescribed R[Crot-h] 30th trituration, 30 gr. in four ounces of water, a teaspoonful every hour, until my return visit, twenty-four hours later, when I found marked improvement. Temperature normal; pulse full, soft and regular; delirium gone; saliva and urine slightly tinged with blood; appetite returning, he having asked for food for the first time since the accident." The medicine was continued for two more days, when recovery was practically complete. S{The action on the right side is noteworthy, as R[crot-h]. is predominantly a right-side medicine (R[lach]. is more left); it acts strongly on the liver and corresponds to jaundice and yellow fever.}
:div-end

S{R[Crot-h] has been used with great success in the treatment of yellow fever, and also as a prophylactic against it. For this, inoculation with diluted virus has been practised.} 
S{The 2[pains] of R[Crot-h] alternate rapidly with each other, and frequently recur; also (except headache) appear and disappear suddenly after lasting some time.} 

S{Swelling of whole body.}
S{Fetor of evacuations and discharges.}
S{Haemorrhages from all the orifices and even pores of the skin.}
S{2[Peculiar sensations] are: as from a blow on occiput; as if tongue and all round throat were tied up; as of a plug in throat to be swallowed; of choking; as if the heart turned over like a tumbler pigeon.}
S{Periodicity marks many of the symptoms.}
S{Metastasis of erysipelas to brain.}
S{Many symptoms are B[<] in morning on waking; or wake the patient up in the night.}
S{Orbital pains B[<] in evening.}
S{Rest B[>], and motion and exertion 2[<].}
S{Open air B[>] head and stomach symptoms.}
S{Cold air B[<] throat and respiratory symptoms.}
S{Dry air B[<] cough.}
