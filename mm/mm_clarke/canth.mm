:rubric=Characteristics.
S{I[Cantharis] belongs to the animal kingdom and finds its most prominent sphere of action in exciting the animal passions. There is anger in a very acute degree amounting to paroxysms of rage; and a corresponding condition of the bodily tissues. The word "2[irritation"] best expresses the totality of the R[Canth] effects.} 

S{The pains are burning, and sharp, lancinating along the course of a nerve. Neuralgia of head and face from taking cold, with loud screams and jerking of muscles. The slightest touch or approach aggravates the mental symptoms. Violent spasms reproduced by touching larynx. There is also B[<] from dazzling objects and by water} S{completing the hydrophobia picture. It may be well to remember in this connection the violent erotic action of R[canth]., for many have maintained that rabies only arises among domesticated animals where sexual functions are under more or less abnormal conditions. Guernsey gives as the special indications in hydrophobia: "Moaning and violent cries, interspersed with barking." R[canth]. produces amorous frenzy, unbounded sexual desire; also sexual erethism and excitability. It acts on the brain, producing inflammation of the tissues. The eyes are bright, pupils widely dilated. Erysipelas commencing in nose. The face is generally pale or yellowish, with an expression of deep-seated suffering. There is diphtheritic inflammation of throat, severe burning, constriction; thirst, with aversion to drinking. The stomach is inflamed. Pain in abdomen colic-like, doubling the patient up, cutting, burning, lancinating. Dysenteric stools with tenesmus. In the genito-urinary region the most intense action is developed. There is extreme superficial sensitiveness in hypogastrium (especially when the bladder is full), attended with unbearable tenesmus vesicae. Cutting, burning pains from the kidney down to urethra. Strangury. Can pass only a few drops, like molten lead. Irritation of all grades. The sexual appetite is aroused to the point of mania. Coitus does not always reduce it. On the skin and serous membranes the irritating effects of the remedy are equally pronounced. Pleurisy with effusion has been cured by the remedy given internally. Burning, stitches, shooting pains and exudation are the indications. So the fly-blister treatment of olden days had more to say for itself than those who used it knew. Vesication is the note of its effects on the skin and indicates its use in burns of the first degree, erysipelas, blisters. In burns the part may be treated with a lotion containing a few drops of the tincture to the ounce of water, a dilution being given internally. An ointment made with the 3x is a good application for herpes zoster. H. N. Guernsey observed that R[canth]. is almost always the remedy for whatever other sufferings there may be, when there is as well frequent micturition with burning, cutting pain; or if cutting burning pain attends the flow, even when micturition is not very frequent. Guernsey also pointed out that R[canth]. should be studied in treating affections of the air-passages when the mucus is tenacious. Nash records a case in which this observation led him to make a pretty cure. R[kali-bi]. had completely failed to relieve a lady who had suffered long from bronchitis. The mucus was profuse, tenacious, and ropy. One day the patient mentioned that she had great cutting and burning on urinating, which she was obliged to do very frequently. R[Canth], made a rapid cure. R[canth]. has cured a case of malarial cachexia in which the symptoms were always B[<] when the urine was scanty. "Burning" runs through the R[canth]. pathogeneses in a very striking way. Another marked feature of the remedy is its effect in increasing the secretions of membranes. R[canth]. "expels moles, dead fetus, placentae; promotes fecundity" (Guernsey). The B[<] is: from drinking; from coffee; from drinking cold water; whilst urinating; after urinating; from touch. B[>] From rubbing; from warm applications.}
