:rubric=Characteristics.
S{The R[Arsenite of Quinine] combines many of the properties of its two components, but having been proved it can be treated as a separate individuality. The periodicity is intensified, and this is especially noted in the neuralgias. An irritable mood precedes the headache, which is B[<] by mental and bodily exercise. The gastralgia of 2[R[chin-ar].] is pressure in solar plexus with tender spine just at back of it. Nausea and vomiting are followed by sleep. Bonino (I[H. R.], iv 210), who gave it a prolonged proving, found the symptoms B[<] at rest; in the morning; and when the stomach was empty. They were B[>] by motion (vertigo); and by eating (gastralgia). The chief effects were manifested on the stomach, solar plexus, ligaments and skin. According to him it corresponds to tobacco intoxication and its effects; indigestion from unripe fruits; gastralgia from coarse food or ill-baked bread; chronic rheumatism of joints without swelling; tertiary syphilis of periosteum; colic from incarcerated flatus; intermittent fever with predominating chills, little thirst and continuous almost convulsive yawning; effects of severe and depressing influences on the mind; to convalescence from long-lasting sickness. The circulation was slow, and limbs relaxed. Weakness, prostration, and disinclination for mental exertion were marked in several provers.}
