:rubric=Characteristics.
S{Growing on the mountains, R[Arn] may be said to possess a native affinity to the effects of falls. As its German name, Fallkraut, attests, its value as a vulnerary has been known from remote times. It may be said to be the traumatic 2[par excellence.] Trauma in all its varieties and effects, recent and remote, is met by R[Arn] as by no other single drug, and the provings bring out the appropriateness of the remedy in the symptoms it causes. Tumours in many parts, following injury, have been cured by R[Arn], including scirrhous tumours of the breast. Nervous affections as chorea after falls. It is suited to plethoric red-faced persons; "R[Arn] is particularly adapted to sanguine, plethoric persons, with lively complexions and disposed to cerebral congestion. It acts but feebly on persons who are positively debilitated, with impoverished blood and soft flesh. This may be the reason why it is eaten with impunity by herbivorous animals as Linneus remarks" (Teste). It is suited to persons who are extremely sensitive to mechanical injuries, and who feel the effects of them long after; persons easily made train-sick or sea-sick. Patients complain that the bed is hard no matter how soft it may be. R[Arn] corresponds to the effects of violent cough or sneezing; the child cries before cough comes on (or with the cough) in whooping-cough. Chronic bronchitis when patients have bruised, weak aching in the chest, or great sensitiveness of the chest on exertion, or walking. Allied to wounds are hæmorrhages, and R[Arn] causes and cures hæmorrhages of many kinds: dilatation and rupture of small blood-vessels. Vomiting, coughing, purging, accompanied by streaks of blood in ejecta; extravasation of blood into the conjunctiva as in whooping-cough. Hæmorrhages into the tissues of internal organs or the skin. An odd symptom of R[Arn] is "coldness of the nose." A case of facial (left) neuralgia, face swollen, dark red, very painful to touch, was cured with R[Arn] (R[Radix]), the guiding symptom being "cold nose." Patient had bitter taste; was very excitable, and B[<] at night. Ussher notes that the local use of R[Arn] produced an extraordinary growth of hair on a limb. This suggested the use of an oil mixed with R[Arn] 1x in a case of baldness, which was followed with marked success. R[Arn] affects the left upper extremity and the right chest. There is a putridity in connection with R[Arn] excretions, as with R[Bapt], which it resembles in typhoid conditions: putrid breath; fetid sweat. With R[Arn] there is apt to be incessant passing of stool and urine in these states. Nash gives the following as "leaders": "Stupor, with involuntary discharge of fæces and urine." "Fears being touched or struck by those coming near him." Putrid smell from mouth." "Bruised, sore feeling in uterine region; cannot walk erect." "While answering falls into a deep stupor before finishing." "Head alone, or face alone, hot; rest of body cool." "Many small boils, painful, one after another, extremely sore." "Suddenness" is a feature of Arn. pains and action. P. P. Wells relates a cure of double pleuro-pneumonia in a child with sudden stabbing pains on both sides of the chest almost preventing breathing. R[Arn] 2[instantl] caused a violent aggravation, the next instant relief was perfect, and the child fell asleep breathing naturally. I once ran a piece of wire into the tip of one of my fingers, causing paralysing pain. I applied R[Arn] 1x at once, and the pain was better instantly} S{seeming to be wiped out from the point of injury up the arm. There is B[<] in damp, cold weather with R[Arn], which is included by Grauvogl among the remedies suited to the hydrogenoid constitution (comp. R[Bar-c]). Motion and exertion B[<]. (Bruised, aching sensation in chest on walking.) B[>] Lying down, and lying with head low; but B[<] lying on left side}
S{R[Arn] should not be used externally where there is broken skin. For torn and lacerated wounds R[Calen] must be used locally}
