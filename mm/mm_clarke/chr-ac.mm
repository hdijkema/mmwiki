:rubric=Characteristics.
S{The symptoms of these two substances are nearly identical, and may be taken together as Hering has taken them. Symptoms of the Acid are distinguished by (A.) after each; those of the Sesquioxide by (S.). Symptoms common to both are unmarked. R[chr-ac] is a powerful antiseptic, and has been used for disinfecting purposes, to arrest fetid discharge, and correct fetid odours. "Foul smelling, sanious lochia" is an indication. Allopaths have used it in 10 per cent. solution for checking excessive foot-sweat} S{a very dangerous practice, but to homoeopaths it may suggest a possible internal use. It causes, in strong solution, inflammation and destruction of epithelium and mucous membranes; a false membrane; gangrene. On the skin it has been used to destroy warts. Cutting pains in eyes. Cough, hard, sometimes deep; swallows sputa. Vomits breakfast. Symptoms appear and disappear suddenly and return periodically. (The 2[suddenness] of many of the symptoms is very marked.) Disagreeable pricking and itching here and there, with uneasiness in limbs. On turning to right side, pain in left side goes off (S.). Pains suddenly shifting to various parts of trunk, on waking (S.). Sensation of a vacuum at heart; of emptiness in chest. The rheumatic symptoms are well-marked, and I have frequently obtained good results in rheumatic cases with both preparations. The symptoms are B[<] least draught of air (A.); and by cold water (A). B[<] Night and early morning, 2 to 6 a.m. Pain B[<] left side.}


:rubric=Relations.

S{Both should be studied along with R[kali-bi].}

:rubric2=Antidotes

S{R[Daph] has cured the rheumatic pains. R[merc-c]. in small doses has counteracted the general effects in workmen. The restlessness and relief from motion suggest R[rhus-t].}
