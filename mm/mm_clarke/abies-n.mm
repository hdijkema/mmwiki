:rubric=Characteristics.
S{The grand characteristic of R[Abies-n] is a sensation in the cardiac end of the stomach or in the œsophagus where it enters the stomach, as if a hard body, as a hard-boiled egg, had lodged there. (R[China] has the lump under the sternum, but higher up. Feeling in the epigastrium as if food were lying there, R[Puls], R[Bry]) Where, this symptom is present, whether in dyspepsia, lung disease (when the sensation is as if there was a hard substance to be coughed up) with or without hæmoptysis, constipation, R[Abies-n] will be, the most likely remedy. The dyspepsias caused by abuse of tea or tobacco have been cured by it. Wakeful at night with hunger. Distress in the head, with flushed cheeks, often accompanies the dyspeptic symptoms of this remedy. In one patient to whom I gave it chilliness round stomach was removed and general chilliness greatly lessened. 2[< ]After eating. "Pain in the stomach always comes after eating," says Guernsey}
