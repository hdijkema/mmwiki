:rubric=Characteristics.
S{R[Am-c] is a right-side medicine and a venous medicine. A condition of under-oxygenation underlies a large proportion of symptoms. Consequently it is a chilly medicine with great sensitiveness to cold open air, 2[<] in wet, stormy weather; from washing; from wet poultice; 2[>] by warmth. It is suited to stout women who readily take cold in winter. 2[<] At night: 3 a.m. It is also hæmorrhagic. There is the scorbutic condition of bleeding gums. Bleeding from the nose, especially in the morning on washing; after a meal. Bleeding piles; at every menstrual period bleeding from rectum. The menses are premature and copious, the blood being dark (colic and pains in loins, or toothache accompanying). Somnolence accompanies many conditions. Bloody expectoration accompanying the cough. Tickling cough. Asthma. Cough from 2 to 5 a.m. Anguish at heart: palpitation and faintness. Pain as from fatigue (hip-joint; legs, thighs). Pains as from dislocation or sprain (wrist, great toe). Pain as of contraction of tendons. Numbness and stiffness of arms and hands. The pains are ulcerative; shooting, digging. Miliary eruption. Swelling of glands. Headache 2[<] in morning; with nausea. Hammering, pressing, bursting; as if contents would start through forehead. Feeling of looseness of brain} S{as if it fell from side to side, whichever way the head was moved. Burning in eyes; dryness; black spots; sparks; myopia; cataract; catarrh. Muscular asthenopia from prolonged use of the eyes, with appearance of yellow spots on looking at white objects. Pterygium, A curious symptom is: Inability to blow the nose, in children. Dry, stuffed coryza, 2[<] at night, breathes with mouth open. Boil on the tip of the nose. Skin of face tight, as if swollen. Foul breath. Toothache, pulling or starting (during catamenia). Sore throat, as of something sticking in it; scraping; spasm; difficult swallowing. Nausea, vomiting, fulness, water-brash, 2[<] after eating. Flatulence. Slow, hard evacuations in small pieces. Piles during menstrual period. Miliary eruptions. Dry tetters; excoriations; ulcerations, phagedenic. Restlessness; paralytic weakness. Great prostration, with falling temperature. Gout in great toe. Heel painful on standing. The venous under-oxygenated condition of the medicine again appears in the excessive sleepiness produced in the daytime. In the night there are dreams of spectres of death and attacks of anguish. The mental faculties are slow; weak memory; heedlessness, absence of mind. Sadness, disposition to weep. Timidity. Apprehensive. Ill-humour. Desperate and unruly. Dr. Gallavardin has cured uncleanness in bodily habits with R[Am-c] The remedy is suited to scrofulous children, stout and sedentary women (most of the carbonates are suited to states of corpulency), women who are always having recourse to the swelling-bottle. Among the ameliorations there are 2[>] lying on stomach (R[Nit-ac]). 2[>] Lying on right side; on painful side. 2[>] From external pressure; in warm room; in dry air. There is 2[<] on bending down. Nose-bleed comes on when washing the face}
