:rubric=Characteristics.
S{R[Croc] has three characteristics which clearly call for its use when met with.}

* S{The first is haemorrhage from various parts (nose, uterus, etc.), when the blood is black, viscid, clotting, forming itself into long black strings, hanging from the bleeding orifice.} 
* S{The second is a peculiar sensation as if something alive were moving about in the abdomen or chest. This may be a definite sensation, or it may be a hallucination or fixed idea. A curious circumstance in this connection is the fact that R[Croc] has often been successfully given to pregnant women who have complained of violent foetal movements, as well as in cases of imaginary pregnancy.} 
* S{The remaining characteristic is in the mental sphere. It is a rapid alternation of mental conditions: anger with violence rapidly followed by repentance; laughter quickly followed by tears.} 

:div-begin=quote
I once cured with a few doses of R[Croc] a young artist who had become subject to violent outbursts of rage in which he would take up a knife to throw at his mother, with whom he lived, and almost immediately after would be abjectly repentant. The household was on the point of being broken up when the trouble was completely removed by R[croc].
:div-end

S{Uncontrollable laughter is also in the R[Croc] symptomatology. Hysterical laughter is one of the effects observed by the older physicians.} 

:div-begin=quote
Teste cites from Murray the case of several children "who were seized with an extraordinary laughing mania, from having smelled of leather bottles that had contained essence of saffron."

:div-begin=quote
On one occasion, in hospital, I happened to see a young girl who was really desperately ill with heart failure and valvular disease, in a fit of hysterical laughter. This made me think of R[croc]. The only definite sensation she complained of in the heart region was a "jumping" sensation. R[Croc] 30 was given, and very soon she was able to lie down flat (after having been propped up for weeks), and from that time she made a rapid recovery.
:div-end 

S{Jumping sensation in the heart region.}

S{Another R[Croc] symptom is: Sensitive to music, involuntarily joins in on hearing any one sing.} 
S{Stitches, shocks, throbbings, broad thrusts, cuttings and jerkings are among the commoner sensations.} 
S{Twitchings of single sets of muscles (chorea).} 
S{A warm sensation ascending to the heart, impeding breathing and B[>] by yawning is a peculiar symptom.} S{Tingling, crawling, pricking and itching are met with in the skin.} 
S{Scarlet redness of the whole body, or scarlet spots on skin. (It is a domestic remedy for "bringing out" the eruption of measles.)} 
S{Painful suppuration of bruised parts; old cicatrised wounds re-open and suppurate.} 
S{Lipoma and encephaloma of scalp.} 
S{Tumours with ulceration and characteristic bleeding.} 

:div-begin=quote
The reputation of R[Croc] in the cure of tumours is also an old one. It was used externally "to scatter indolent tumours and ecchymoses." Cooper has given it new confirmation. He has given it in single doses of the Ã˜ tincture in a case of malignant disease of the side following extirpation of cancerous kidney, with the result of arrest of progress after an initial aggravation, and complete relief of pain. The patient was a woman, who had formerly had haemorrhage with dark clots at the periods and feeling of weight towards womb. She had had also the sensation of something moving in the abdomen.

Cooper agrees with Culpepper in thinking R[croc]. very similar to R[calen]. in its action.

S{It is a vulnerary and corresponds to the effects of blows (deafness; tumours, etc.).} 
S{R[Croc] is especially suited to women and hysterical men.} 

S{The symptoms are B[<] fasting; evening and night; during new and full moon; looking fixedly at an object; during pregnancy; in a hot room; in hot weather.
