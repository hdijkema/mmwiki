S{The heart is slowed, or else its action is made rapid and feeble or "sensation as if the heart stood still." 
R[dig] has: Sensation as if the heart would stand still if he moved.} 
S{According to Hale R[Digin] is specially indicated in cases of "overburdened heart where it is 2[constantly labouring]. "} 
S{Irregular and intermittent action.} 

S{A sinking, faint sensation is felt at the epigastrium, nausea and vomiting of yolk-of-egg matter, shivering, diarrhoea, the stools not being noted characteristically white as are those of the plant.} 

S{Sensitiveness of eyes to light and nose to odours.}

One prover noted: 

S{"frontal headache, dazzlings, loss of appetite, sinking at epigastrium, intestinal flatulence, borborygmi, eructation, slight abdominal pains; urine abundant; great fatigue; painful heat in evening but no thirst." For a whole day pressure in supra-orbital region towards frontal sinus, and when walking a feeling as if the ground gave way under his feet. Sexual weakness is shown in: Deep sleep in which an emission occurs without waking him;" and "Sexual power diminished or quite abolished temporarily."}

R[Digin] has cured the following case: Mrs. had for over a year swelling of right hand and fingers, which she thought to be rheumatic. R[dig] has the symptom, "swelling of right hand and fingers," and this would have been given but only R[Digin] was at hand. This was given in 4x. After the second dose the swelling began to subside, and in two or three days was completely gone. (I[H. W.], xxvi. 552).
