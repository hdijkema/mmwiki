:rubric=Characteristics.
S{R[Aesc] is a great pile remedy. In some districts it is a popular custom to carry a chestnut in the pocket as a preventive. It produces many symptoms of disordered liver: Malaise; dulness of head and mind; fulness at root of nose. Follicular pharyngitis with dryness; burning; roughness; contraction in throat, as in follicular pharyngitis. There is soreness and fulness in liver region; the abdomen is sore to touch. There is jaundice with bileless stools. Throbbing in abdomen, especially hypogastrium}

S{The most intense action is on the lower bowel and pelvic organs. There are hæmorrhoids, blind or bleeding; if they bleed it gives relief. Feeling of dryness in rectum as if little sticks or splinters were pricking the folds of mucous membrane; with weak feeling in sacro-iliac joints, as if legs would give way. (R[Arg-n] has also pain in sacro-iliac joints and sensation as if the bones were loose.) Constipation, stools large, hard, followed by feeling of prolapse of rectum. General aching in lumbar and sacral regions, with stiffness in the back, almost impossible to walk. Tearing in the small of the back and hips}

S{Poisoning with the green rind of horse-chestnut has produced the following symptoms in a boy: Pupils widely dilated in bright light. Face flushed; pulse full. Drowsy and apparently slept, but the sleep was interrupted at short intervals by sudden awakenings and screams. Great terror as from a dreadful dream, or apparition on opening his eyes. Questioning failed to elicit the cause of his terror}
S{R[Aesc] patients are, as a rule, despondent and irritable. Walking greatly 2[< ]all symptoms. Cold air and cold seasons 2[<;] nose and throat very sensitive when inhaling; 2[< ]after washing. 2[> ]Summer; 2[< ]winter (hæmorrhoids)}
