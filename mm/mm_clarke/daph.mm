:rubric=Characteristics.
R[Daph] was proved by G. Bute. It is like its relative R[D. mezereon] in producing affections of muscles, bones, and skin, hence its relation to syphilis and the anti-syphilitic remedies R[aur]., R[Merc]. R[Staph].
S{Its pains are erratic and electric-like.} S{It is like R[Jambos] in the craving for tobacco.} S{The skin is clammy.} S{Red rash in spots on legs in evening.} S{Itching.} 
R[Daphne oleoides] is credited by Hering with relieving leprosy. 

A peculiar symptom of R[Daph] is S{tongue coated on one side only (R[rhus-t] has the same, only the R[rhus-t] coating is specified as white).} 

Other symptoms are: 

S{Foul-smelling tongue.}
S{Ptyalism with hot saliva.}
S{Cold feeling on buttocks.}
S{Sudden stitch in region of spleen.}
S{Fetidity is a marked feature-breath, urine, sweat.}
S{The pains are apt to be sudden.}
S{They wander suddenly from extremities.}
S{Ball of right great toe swollen and very painful; the pain suddenly shoots into the body to region of heart, or some other part of body to abdomen.}
S{It is probable that a sensation of parts of the body being separated from one another is characteristic of R[Daph].} 
S{The symptoms of sensation as if the head were separated appeared in the proving} (I[see] 20).

:div-begin=quote
Erastus E. Case has recorded the cure of a man, 45, obese, rheumatic, who presented these symptoms: "Swaying sensation in the head when walking. Constant sensation as if the head were separated from the body. Sensation as if the vertex were screwed up in a vice. While driving a horse, sensation as if the arias were detached from the body, yet they are under complete control of the will."
