:rubric=Characteristics.
Z{The chief feature of the 2[Drosera] effects is a S{spasmodic cough resembling whooping-cough, in which affection it is one of the leading remedies, as it is also in the spasmodic cough of phthisis}.} 


S{The characteristic cough is: Frequent spells of barking cough; B[<] evening and after midnight; patient holds his side; vomits if he cannot get up phlegm; every effort to raise a little phlegm ends in retching and vomiting; there may be bloody stools.} 


Z{I[Teste], who places 2[Drosera] in his 2[Zincum] group of medicines, mentions that it grows in damp prairies, along the border of marshes, and is avoided by animals. I[Barrich] states that when eaten by sheep it gives them a cough which is fatal to them. Curiously enough, it was recommended by German physicians of the eighteenth century as a panacea for hoarseness, chest affections, and even for phthisis. I[Serrand, of Paris] (translated I[H. R.], vi. 153) maintains that S{Drosera has an important I[role] in the prophylaxis of tubercle.} He refers to the fact that sheep eating 2[Drosera] leaves acquire a nocturnal cough and die, and that the pleurae of cats to which Drosera had been administered were found studded with tubercles.} 


S{The indications calling for it in the premonitory stage are: pallor, weakness, loss of appetite, dry cough, emaciation.} 


Z{Three laryngoscopic indications are:} 

1 S{Anaemia and pallor of larynx;} 
1 S{vocal cords not sufficiently approximated from functional impairment of crico-arytenoid muscles;} 
1 S{redness and swelling of mucous membrane covering and between the arytenoid cartilages.} 


Z{I[Dr. Serrand] commends R[dros]. in cases of declared phthisis as well. He gives it in the low attenuations. I[Buchmann of Alvensleben] agrees with Hahnemann that R[dros] in high attenuation should not be repeated. He cured himself of a bronchial catarrh which used to attack him every spring and fall, characterised by a S{2[violent tickling cough], which almost drove him to distraction at night}, with R[dros]. 1x. and Ã˜. A single dose as soon as the tickling in the larynx commenced sufficed to allay it at once and allowed him to rest, and it was only repeated when the tickling returned.}


Z{Among the characteristics of 2[Drosera] are:}

S{Spasmodic and constricting pains in abdomen; larynx; throat; chest; hypochondria.} 
S{Crawling in larynx; feeling as if a soft substance were lodged in larynx, as a feather.} 
S{Difficult swallowing of solids.} 
S{Voice fails.} 


S{Stitching pains in chest and all parts; lancinations in brain.} 
S{Stitches from left loin into penis; itching stitches in glans.} 


S{Haemorrhages of bright red blood, from nose; mouth (bloody saliva); with vomit; with stool; expectoration.} 
S{Gnawing stinging pains in joints and long bones.} 

Z{R[dros]. has many pains about the hip-joints and has cured sciatica with the following characters:}

S{"Pressing pains, B[<] from pressure, from stooping, from lying on painful part, B[>] after rising from bed."} 
S{Eruption like measles; prickling burning itching; B[<] undressing; B[>] by scratching; bleeding, burning ulcers, cutting pains.} 
S{Epileptic attacks: with rigidity; with twitching of limbs; after attack, haemoptysis and sleep.}
