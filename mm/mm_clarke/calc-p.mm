:rubric=Characteristics.
S{R[calc-p]., whilst exhibiting strong points of resemblance with R[calc]., has nevertheless a very distinct individuality. It has been proved and tested clinically, and, having been adopted by SchÃ¼ssler as his leading "antisporic," a number of valuable indications have been added by him and his followers. The R[calc-p]. patient is generally emaciated instead of fat like the typical R[calc]. child. The R[calc-p]. patient is less chalky-white and more dirty-white or brownish than the R[calc]. patient. Both have large abdomens, but that of the R[calc-p]. patient is flabby. R[calc], has craving for eggs; R[calc-p]. for salt or smoked meats. "Craving for fat bacon" in children is a well-verified characteristic of R[calc-p]. R[calc-p]. has cured dyspepsia, pain B[>] for a short time by raising wind, when fasting the pain goes to the spine, feeling as if one ought to raise wind and could not. Dyspepsia with indescribable distress in region of stomach, only temporarily B[>] by eating. The stools of R[calc-p]. are green and slimy, or hot and watery with fetid flatus; of R[calc]., sometimes green, generally watery, white, and mixed with curds. R[calc]. has an open anterior fontanelle; R[calc-p]. has both open, especially the posterior. The skull is thin and soft, almost cracks, like paper when pressed upon.} S{The mental state of R[calc-p]. is one of weakness: weak memory; inability for mental exertion. Hence it is appropriate in effects of mental strain, such as school headaches in children, weak-minded children. In this it is like R[nat-m]. A schoolboy to whom I was giving R[calc-p]. developed these new symptoms: "Tongue thickly coated white, taste pasty; felt absolutely silly; taking coffee whilst playing a game, he put the sugar on the draught-board instead of into the cup, and didn't know he had done anything foolish." Peevish and fretful. Wants to be at home, and when at home wants to go out; goes from place to place. Complaints are B[<] when thinking of them. The sexual organs are the centre of many symptoms. Nymphomania; all organs in erection with irresistible desire, particularly before catamenia. Voluptuous feeling, as if all the parts were filled with blood; pulses in all the parts with increased desire; after urination. Many of the uterine symptoms are like those of R[sep]. There is a weak, sinking sensation in the hypogastrium, and sinking, empty feeling in epigastrium; prolapsus B[<] during stool or micturition. Aching in uterus. Cutting through to sacrum. Cream-like leucorrhoea. Burning in vagina with pain on both sides of bladder and uterus; burning like fire up into chest. Flushes of heat and faintness; sweats easily. But the menses are profuse, and the patient is weak and consumptive. She has partial profuse sweats, but less profuse than those of R[sep]. Every exposure increases the rheumatic pains of R[calc-p]. and the uterine distress. Defective bone growth; bones thin and brittle. It is useful in cases of fistula; and when fistula has been operated on and symptoms have appeared elsewhere; fistula alternating with chest symptoms. Enlargement of tonsils, acute and chronic. Short breath. Involuntary sighing. Contraction of chest and difficult breathing; evening till 10 p.m., B[>] lying down, B[<] getting up. Constant stretching and yawning. Crying out in sleep. Cannot get awake in morning. Grauvogl considered it the most important remedy in chronic hydrocephalus, and he very properly gave it as a prenatal remedy during pregnancy to women who had previously borne hydrocephalic children. The chills of R[calc-p]. strike upward. Hering gives: "The chills run up the back; terrible muscular jerks in body, which almost throw him out of his chair."} 

S{2[R[calc-p].] corresponds to defective nutrition, whether of childhood, puberty, or of old age. Predisposition to glandular and bone diseases. Slow development of teeth. Spinal curvature. Slow walking; neck too thin and weak to support head. Rickets. Diabetes when the lungs are affected. Motion B[<] and rest B[>] most symptoms. B[<] When thinking of his symptoms. A slight draught causes rheumatic pains; every cold causes pains in joints and sutures. Changes of weather, especially when the snow melts, or in east winds 2[<.] Damp, rainy, cold weather 2[<.] It is suited to scrofulous, gouty constitutions.}
