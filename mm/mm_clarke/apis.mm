:rubric=Characteristics.
S{The well-known effects of a bee's sting} S{burning, stinging, lancinating pain with excessive swelling} S{give leading keynotes for its employment in a great variety of conditions. In addition to these there is great sensitiveness of the surface to touch. General soreness: "every hair is painful to contact." Great debility as if he had worked hard; is compelled to lie down. Tired and bruised feeling. Great restlessness and fidgetiness (the R[Ars] restlessness is more from mental anxiety). Trembling, jerking, and twitching. One half of the body twitching, the other lame or paralysed. Hemiplegia. R[Apis] is more a right-side medicine; symptoms proceed from right to left (R[Rhus-t] left to right) and from above downwards. In an involuntary proving of Apis in a woman (of forty, strong, florid, of full habit) Who kept bees and was frequently stung without constitutional effect, the following marked and peculiar symptoms were occasionally noted in addition to the better known ones (I[New. Eng. Med. Gaz.], Nov., 1887): Stiffness of lower jaw, soon amounting to a sense of complete fixation. This stiffness extended to tongue and throat, rendering speech difficult and unintelligible, and causing a condition of extreme discomfort, the stiffness being accompanied by a feeling of constriction, which excited a single, spasmodic, backing cough at short intervals. Some difficulty in breathing, especially in inspiration. These symptoms were accompanied by a terrible restlessness. On a later occasion there was dyspnśa, face purple, head thrown back. The same symptoms as above recurred, but the throat was more swollen and the distress extended below the larynx to the upper part of the lung, which soon became very sore and sensitive. An hour after the sting on this occasion a violent cough came on. It seemed to be excited by the constrictive feeling in the throat, but it reached down to the sore place in the lungs, causing great distress. It was a deep, hard, ringing cough, lasting without intermission for three hours. Traces of the cough and soreness lasted for months. Another symptom was an ominous twitching of muscles of extremities controlled by hot foot and hand baths. R[Led] gave almost instantaneous relief to the graver symptoms}

S{The burning symptoms of R[Apis] are distinguished from those of R[Ars] in being B[<] by heat. The stinging appears in many diseases and conditions, causing the "2[crie cérébrale"] in acute hydrocephalus and meningitis. Stinging pains in hćmorrhoids. "Redness and swelling with stinging and burning pain in eyes, eyelids, ears, face, lips, tongue, throat, anus, testicles." Śdema of the throat may be accompanied with stinging pains, but if the case is more advanced it may be absolutely painless, and then it is more dangerous. (R[Bapt] has painlessness in throat affections but less śdema.} S{Nash.}
S{R[Apis] has slow action and must not be changed too soon. Increased flow of urine shows it is having a favourable effect. The dropsies of R[Apis] are characterised by a waxy hue of skin, whitish or yellowish; transparent swelling of eyelids; bag-like swelling under eyes; surface of body sore, bruised, or burning. In cardiac dropsy the feet swell after walking, and are intolerably sore and burning. In chest affections there is sensation of contraction (R[Lach]) and inability to lie down. Tension, swelling, and stiffness of limbs. This tight sensation is manifested in another symptom: sensation in abdomen as if something tight would break if too much effort was made to void a constipated stool. Aversion to tight things like R[Lach] Prostration even to faintness. Paralytic weakness. Paralysis (after diphtheria and other severe diseases). Nervous, restless, over-sensitive; or hot and drowsy, with or without thirst. B[<] From touch or pressure (though the head is B[>] by pressure). In this R[Apis] resembles the Antimonies, and it is like them in sensitiveness to heat, especially to heated rooms (R[Puls], R[Iod], R[Kali-i], R[Camph], R[Sec], R[Sulph]); B[<] by warmth of bed. Cold water B[>]. Many symptoms (eyes and chest) are B[<] in the night, and sleep is disturbed by piercing cries, or else by moaning and whining. B[<] In morning: mucus in mouth, restlessness, diarrhśa. B[<] In evening: erysipelas, giddiness, headache, chills, fever. Many symptoms are B[<] lying down, and B[>] sitting}
