:rubric=Characteristics.
R[Cupr-ar] combines the characters of its two metallic components. 

S{Intense neuralgic pains in abdomen; awful distress in epigastric region; burning along oesophagus and in urethra; numbness; creeping, itching, and chilly sensations.} 

According to J. N. Majumdar, who gives a case, the great characteristic of R[Cupr-ar] in choleraic conditions is "S{icy-coldness of the whole body, with cramps and an obstinate hiccough}." 

B. L. Bhaduri pointed this out to him. Salzer has shown that "S{cold, clammy perspiration of 2[intermittent nature}"] is unique and characteristic. He has found it most valuable in the S{collapse stage of cholera, where intermittent cold, clammy sweat was noted}. 

S{The skin is very sensitive to touch; and pressure B[<] all symptoms.} S{Rest B[>] and motion B[<] most symptoms; but motion B[>] stiffness of back and tingling of hands.} S{Damp weather I[=] neuralgia of abdomen.} S{Weakness and restlessness.} S{There is a periodicity in the symptom.}
