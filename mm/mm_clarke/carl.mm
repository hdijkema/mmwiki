:rubric=Characteristics.
S{R[Carlsbad water] is a very complicated solution containing the sulphite, bicarbonate and chloride of sodium in preponderating quantity, with carbonates, sulphates, phosphates, fluoride and oxides of Calcium, Magnesium, Strontium, Ferrum, Manganum, Potassium, Aluminium, Silicon, and Carbon, with traces of iodide and bromide of sodium, of Caesium, Rubidium, Lithium, and Boracic oxide. Its chief fame has been gained by its action on the liver, and in the treatment of obesity and diabetes. Its action has been observed on some healthy persons, but the bulk of the symptoms, many of which are strikingly peculiar, have been obtained from patients under treatment. They are, however, sufficiently characteristic and have furnished the indications for many homoeopathic cures. Most prominent are the following: Sensation of prostration; of weakness so that she trembled and could hold nothing securely. Tired, dejected, sluggish; anxious trembling. Weakness of all organs; of organs of speech (2[Sermo abdominalis]); of bladder (stream weak and slow, only passed with assistance of abdominal muscles); of rectum (stool slow and only passed with help of distant parts of intestinal canal; peristaltic motion seemed to cease not far from end of intestines and no amount of pressure was of any avail; faeces seemed held back rather than pushed forward.) General discomfort. General anxious sensation as if blood in artery would stagnate, with constant flushes of heat. Pains: dislocated and spraining; drawing; tearing, stitching; burning; dull shocks and jerks. I have found R[Carl] in the potencies admirably respond to its indications. W. J. Guernsey cured with it sciatica in an old man, with cramp in left ankle. About a month after ceasing the remedy the patient complained that he felt paralysed in the loins for several hours after rising from bed, better as the day advanced. This was a new symptom very like the R[Carl] effects. Periodicity is noted: effects repeated after from two to four weeks. The skin has red spots and streaks, frequently burning like fire. Pimples and pustules. Crawling and prickling on various parts, with breaking out of sweat. Itching on various parts. Much itching and increased sweat of genitals. Increased sensitiveness of the skin. Sensitiveness to cold air; great liability to take cold. Frequent alternations of shuddering, chilliness, and heat. Flushes of heat all over, especially in face, with sweat on forehead. Heat of head with redness of face and creeping shudders. Sweats more easily. Sweat, stains linen yellow. Symptoms B[<] morning and evening; after eating and drinking; on ascending; after lying down in bed. B[>] In open air; on motion. Even the headaches are B[>] by motion.}
