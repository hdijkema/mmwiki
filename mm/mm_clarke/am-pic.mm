:rubric=Characteristics.
S{R[Pic-ac] and its combinations are very powerful medicinal substances of the nitric acid group.} 
S{Allen gives this indication for R[Am-pic] (which has had only a fragmentary proving): Periodical neuralgia in right side of occiput, boring extending to the ear, orbit and jaw; vertigo on rising, especially in irregular menstruation.} 
S{Hale, who introduced the remedy to homeopathy, commends it in congestion of brain and spinal cord. Heavy, pressive pains in occiput and mastoid region; on sides of head to temples and eyes. Face darkly flushed. Mind obtuse, disinclined to labour. Periodic bilious headache like that of R[Sang], and R[Cimic]. One case he cured had these symptoms: Middle-aged woman, short, stout, florid, every six or eight days would wake in morning with violent pain in occipital region, heaviness of head, vertigo on rising. Pain B[<] on getting up; extended over sides of head to temples and eyes. In afternoon nausea and vomiting of sour bilious matter. Another case was that of a doctor who had been thrown from his carriage and injured about the back of his head. He seemed more frightened than hurt, but in a few days he noticed that on turning in bed, or stooping, or on any sudden motion, he would be seized with a "wild feeling" in the occiput, trembling beating of heart with intermission, and great alarm. R[Am-pic] completely relieved him after other medicines had been given in vain.} 
S{R[Am-pic] is intensely bitter, and like R[Pic-ac] and other picrates has a strong action on the liver. R[Pic-ac], like R[Am-pic], has occipital headache, proceeding down the spine; and also a pain travelling the reverse way. I gave great relief with R[Pic-ac] in a case of spinal paresis in which a pain rising up the spine into the head was complained of. I think it is the R[Pic-ac] element in this ammonia salt that accounts for its action in these cases of Hale's}
