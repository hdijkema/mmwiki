:rubric=Characteristics.
S{R[calen] belongs to the same family as those other great Vulneraries R[arn] and 2[R[bell-p].] The special kind of wounds indicating its use are 2[lacerated] wounds and 2[suppurating] wounds. It is the homoeopathic antiseptic} S{it restores the vitality of an injured part, making it impregnable against the forces of putrefaction. Unlike R[arn] it has no irritating property capable of producing erysipelas. It is therefore suitable to all cases of injury where the skin is broken. Jahr, who was in Paris during the 2[Coup d'Ã‰tat] of 1849, treated a number of cases of gun-shot wounds with comminuted bones, and saved several limbs by means of 2[Calendula.] It prevented suppuration and pyaemia. In some cases of carbuncle it acts with great promptitude, subduing pain and fever. In obstetric practice it is invaluable. The application of a sponge saturated with a hot solution of R[calen] after delivery gives the greatest comfort to the patient. Hot R[calen] lotions are generally preferable to cold, as they conserve the vitality of the injured parts. Hot R[calen] fomentations, intermittently applied, are far better than poultices as applications to forming abscesses. If they do not abort the process they favour the maturation and ultimate healing. C. R. Crosby (2[H. R.], xii, 370) gives it internally (in the 3x) as well as externally. He has also had excellent results from its use as a hot compress (an ounce to the pint) in pneumonia and other internal inflammations. It is an excellent haemostatic in tooth-extractions. R[calen] has not been largely proved, but very definite fever symptoms have been elicited, and cases of jaundice have been treated with it successfully. Some of the symptoms are Irritability; easily frightened; great tendency to start, nervousness hearing very acute. Drinking aggravates; also damp weather. Cooper gives this modality: B[<] in cloudy weather. (The flowers close when a dark cloud passes over.) Drinking causes a shaking chill or creeping crawls; even during the heat. Very sensitive to cold air. Nodosities in breast. In Germany it is regarded as a "cancer cure." Almost all the symptoms make their appearance during the chilly stage of the fever; he feels most comfortable when walking about, or else when lying perfectly still.} 

S{A correspondent of the 2[Hom. World], "C. W." (1891), mentions that a friend of his who chewed for a few minutes a leaf of R[calen] noticed that it entirely removed for some days a difficulty of passing water such as is commonly met with in old men. "C. W.," himself a pharmacist, noticed the following effect on himself when making the fresh-plant tincture: "There was such a feeling as if some overwhelming calamity was hovering over me as to be almost unbearable. Three years ago, just after making the tincture, my old enemy the gout nipped me in the middle of the spine, and in three days spoiled all my powers of walking, and then the dreadful feeling became very much exaggerated." His experience led him to conclude that R[calen] has an action on the spinal cord.}
