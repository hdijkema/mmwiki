:rubric=Clinical

S{Asthma}
S{Cardiac asthma.} 
S{Fever.}
:rubric=Characteristics
S{Hale says Queb. produces in animals respiratory paralysis, slowed heart, and paralysis of extremities}. 
S{It relieves dyspnoa in phthisis and pleurisy, but without influencing the fever}. 
S{The 1x relieved asthma with livid face; and dyspnoa with cyanosis is frequently relieved by it.} 
:rubric=Cases
Hale gives these cases as relieved by it: (1) Mitral incompetence and stenosis with severe nocturnal dyspnoa. (2) Fatty heart (Queb. had no influence on the odema, which was removed by Dig.). 
Jos. P. Cobb (quoted A. H., xxvii. 74) records a case of heart affection of some duration in a man, 24. There was some enlargement, especially of right side, much dyspnoa, and a slight mitral murmur. Following this were signs of emphysema and severe attacks of asthma. Reles were heard, and "pearls" of rounded gelatinous masses were expectorated. Aspidospermine 3x gave more relief than any other remedy.
