:rubric=Characteristics.
S{"There is in R[Chamomilla] a little thread of symptoms, and nearly always found running through it. This is a 2[spiteful, sudden], or 2[uncivil irritability"] (Guernsey).} 

S{Teste puts R[cham]. at the head of one of his groups, which includes 2[R[Grat], R[Viol-t], R[Hell]] The common feature of this group is: "A particular derangement of the cerebral functions and even of the whole nervous system; a painful increase of the sentient action, followed by a considerable depression of the vital forces, and a certain disorder of the mental faculties."} 

S{In spite of its obvious analogies with 2[R[puls]., R[ip]., R[acon].], and R[Con], it has marked and exclusive characteristics of its own. "It increases the general nervous sensibility, and stimulates the cerebral functions: a property that seems to give rise secondarily to the various organic alterations that R[cham]. is capable of producing, and for which it has so often been given with success." "It appears," says Hahnemann, quoted by Teste, "to diminish" ![I[i.e.], curatively] "in a great degree, the excessive sensitiveness to pain and the violent derangements which pain occasions in the moral condition of the patient. This is the reason why it appeases a multitude of sufferings to which coffee-drinkers, and persons who have been treated with narcotic palliatives are subject. And this is likewise the reason why it ought not to be given to those who bear pain patiently and with resignation. I mention this rule here, for it is of very great importance." Teste remarks this, that R[cham]. antidotes not only R[Coff], but also R[Caust], and most of the members of the R[Caust] group.} 

S{Over-sensitiveness, with great irritability and crossness, is the leading note of the 2[Chamomilla] effects. The pains are 2[unbearable] and drive to despair; the patient insists that the doctor shall cure them at once. Prostrating debility as soon as the pains begin. The senses are too acute. Bad temper (2[R[Nux-v] is malicious]). Peevishness; ill-humour; anger, with rage, violence and heat. Cannot bear to be looked at. Cannot be civil to doctor. Impatience. R[cham]. also corresponds to the 2[effects] of anger: colic, diarrhoea, jaundice, twitchings, and convulsions. Child cries, and must be carried about to be quieted. There is 2[hot] sweat on head. Stopped up colds, with dripping of hot water from nose. One cheek red, the other pale. Face sweats after eating or drinking. The patient is hot and thirsty with the pains.} 

S{R[cham]. is almost typical of the dentition state. The toothache of R[cham]. comes on when entering a warm room or from drinking anything warm. There is fetor of breath, and of discharges in general. Biliousness preceded by anger. Gastralgia, food eaten lies like a load on stomach, hypochondria distended. Tongue yellowish white. Bitter taste. Colic B[>] by drinking coffee. The diarrhoea of R[cham]. is: stool hot, yellowish green; like chopped egg; offensive; excoriation round anus. Intertrigo of children. Wind colic; belching of wind B[<] the condition (this is characteristic). Menorrhagia dark clots; fetid; temper always B[<] before and during flow (R[Nux-v] also, but Nux is conscious of it, R[cham]. is not).} 

S{Threatened abortion caused by anger. The pain of labour or at menses is centred in the womb, bearing down, painful contractions, 2[unbearable]; they extend down thighs and are felt in the back. Leucorrhoea is acrid, watery, corrosive, smarting. R[cham]. has inflammation of the parotid glands, nocturnal salivation. Rheumatism compelling to get up and walk about; thirsty, hot, almost beside himself. Muscles of face and hands twitch. Insomnia of children; start in sleep; twitching of hands and face; hot sweat of head and face; one cheek red.} 

S{Puts feet out of bed; soles burn. Aggravation by heat is one of the most prominent features of R[cham]. B[<] By warm food. R[cham]. may be the remedy in croup, or croupy cough, if mental symptoms and time conditions correspond. W. H. Baker (Rochester) has recorded such a case. A chubby boy, light hair, blue eyes had a croupy cough. R[acon]. and R[Spong] at first controlled it, but afterwards failed. The cough became a loose, rattling, suffocating cough; the mucus came up in the throat and nearly suffocated him. Paroxysms at midnight. During the day he was hoarse; ever impatient, nothing seemed to suit him. R[cham]. c. m. cured, improvement setting in within two hours. "Chamomile tea" has removed the night-sweats of phthisis. Dr. Anderson, of Dover, Delaware, relates the case of a man who had to change three to five times every night. A cup of weak chamomile tea was ordered every night. The second night there was slight diminution, the third he only had to change twice, the fourth once, and after that there was no more trouble. The plant in this case was probably R[Anthemis cotula], or wild chamomile of U.S. Dr. Anderson learned its use from "an old woman." But the sweats of R[Chamomilla] are also very marked, Nash mentions a characteristic in the association of 2[numbness] or alternation of it with pains. He relates the case of a man who had very painful rheumatism of left shoulder, and who got no better from the usual remedies, but was speedily cured by R[cham]., the indication being: "Numbness with the pains." Nash differentiates the restlessness of R[acon]. and R[ars]. from that of R[cham]. by the absence in the case of the last of fear of death. The R[cham]. patient "would 2[rather] die than 2[suffer so.]" Lying in bed 2[<.] Walking B[>] backache and rheumatic pains. B[>] Being carried about. Touch, and even looking at the patient, 2[<.] Covering 2[<.] Pains recur in evening and are B[<] before midnight. Symptoms generally B[<] night. Warmth B[<] most symptoms. Cold B[>] ulcers; a finger dipped in cold water and applied to the part B[>] toothache. B[<] From music. Heaviness and fulness of whole body from playing piano. There is desire for open air, and yet over-sensitiveness to open air, especially about ears. Damp cold weather 2[<.] Windy weather 2[<.] Great dread of wind. R[cham]. is particularly suited to diseases of pregnant women, nurses, and little children. Light or brown-haired persons. Arthritic diathesis.}
