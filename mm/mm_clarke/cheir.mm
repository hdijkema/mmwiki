:rubric=Characteristics.
S{Our knowledge of the medicinal use of R[cheir]. is due to Dr. Cooper. The cases cured with it are as follows: (2[1]) Young man, deafness and Otorrhoea left side. Is cutting three wisdom teeth. Cured by two doses of Ã˜ given at six weeks' interval. (2[2]) Girl, 22, deaf after measles, cutting wisdom teeth. Greatly improved. (2[3]) Girl, 20, used to taking purgative pills, had pain in lower back, jaundiced appearance, bilious feeling, sickness of stomach. R[cheir]. removed the symptoms at once. Cooper considers as a keynote of the remedy, "Nose stopped at night from irritation of cutting wisdom teeth."}
