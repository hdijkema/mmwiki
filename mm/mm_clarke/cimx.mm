:rubric=Characteristics.
S{2[Cimex] is an ancient remedy for intermittent fever. A characteristic symptom is: "Weariness and inclination to stretch." The flexors are most affected; pains in all joints as if tendons were contracted and too short; every motion or stretching of arms or legs causes tightening pain in them. (Nash records the following cure by Dr. Brewster, of Syracuse. After driving a fractious horse that tried to run away over a very rough road a man was so bruised and sprained about the buttocks and legs that he was confined to the house for a long time in consequence. It settled finally into what appeared likely to be permanent contraction of the lower limbs. No remedy relieved till Dr. Brewster remembered a case of intermittent fever that he had cured twenty years before, being guided by this symptom. 2[Cimex] 600 (Jenichen) promptly cured.) Irresistible sleepiness. Frequent yawning; sensation as of a cold wind blowing on knees. Pains in all joints as if tendons contracted during chill. Chill commences with clenching of hands and violent raging. Before chill, thirst and heaviness in legs; less thirst with chill, still less with dry heat; none with sweat. After the chill, thirst, but drinking causes violent headache; tickling in larynx causing dry, continuous cough. Gagging and belching at end of cough. Heat with gaging; oesophagus feels constricted. Musty-smelling sweats. Night-sweats. Tertian and quartan intermittents. A. W. K. Choudhury relates a case of intermittent (quotidian) cured with 2[Cimex] 30, the chief indications being: "Chill slight; thirst some days, none other days; shiverings; passed water twice during chill; 2[chill < by lying down; increase of cough if he drinks water during chill."] Stools with haemorrhoidal sufferings. Stools hard in small balls; urging to stool; after the discharge of a small piece of white stool, rectum closes firmly. Incontinence of urine. Urine hot; brown or red sediment. Frequent erections in morning; seminal emissions. Urticarious eruption. Motion 2[<.] Stretching or extending the part 2[<.] Weariness compels to lie down. Sitting B[<] pain in small of back. During rest: in morning, sweat on nose. Symptoms B[<] in morning. B[<] By drinking. The whole right side is especially affected.}
