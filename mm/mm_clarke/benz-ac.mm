:rubric=Characteristics.
S{The leading note of Benzoic acid is the occurrence, as a concomitant of any morbid condition, of strong-smelling urine, generally also dark. Benzoic acid is a chilly medicine, the symptoms being B[<] in open air; by uncovering; B[>] by heat. Pains suddenly change their locality, but are mostly felt in region of heart. Joints crack when moving. Symptoms appear left side first, then right. Asthma has been cured by it, especially in rheumatic persons. Inflammation of bronchi and lungs, with great tenderness of chest, cough B[<] night, lying on right side. Some of the chief symptoms are: Inclined to dwell on unpleasant subjects; if he saw any one deformed it made him shudder. Tongue spongy on surface with deep cracks and spreading ulcers. Sensation of lump (as of food) in pit of throat; of swelling and constriction. Throat symptoms are B[>] by eating. Watery, light, very, offensive stools (in children), stools like soapsuds, with usually strong-smelling urine. Enuresis nocturna; urine dark, strong-smelling; heavy, hot; smelling like horse's urine. Shivering before stool. Long-continued, dry cough after suppressed gonorrhoea. Ganglion of wrist and bunion of great toe I have frequently cured with 2[Benz. ac.] In these cases an ointment (one ounce of the 3x to cetacean ointment one ounce) is a useful external adjunct. Tearing and stitches in great toe, especially right (gout). Swelling and pain of right knee. Gouty concretions. "Most of the symptoms appear on the left side, but may subsequently come on the right" (Guernsey). Motion B[<] most symptoms, but headache is B[<] at rest, and toothache is B[<] lying down.}
