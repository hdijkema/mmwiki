:rubric=Characteristics.
S{R[carbn-s]. combines many characters of its two elements. It was first brought into notice by its effects on workers in rubber works. Here is an 2[acute] case: a girl, aged 15, employed in vulcanising works, was exposed to the fumes one whole day. Before this, she had had from the fumes, frontal pains and heaviness of the head. After this, the pains became more violent, and were accompanied by painful contraction of masseters, then by stiffness of neck and vertebral column; finally of legs and arms. The contracture was generalised, but nowhere complete, though the jaws could not be separated. Ulcerative stomatitis ensued and tartar accumulated on the teeth. Among the 2[chronic] effects are: Digestive disorders of extreme severity. Tremor, giddiness, ringing in the ears with poor hearing; inability to sleep; muscular weakness, more or less ataxia, strong increase of mechanical muscular irritability, disturbance of sight and sensibility, Romberg's symptom (trophoneurosis; facial hemiatrophy); incontinence of urine; impotence. In the 2[Medical Argus] (July to December, 1891) H. H. Crippen has collected from several sources instances of intoxication of workers with R[]. The action on vision was very marked in many cases. Myopia, asthenopia; achromatopsia, dyschromatopsia, cloudiness and atrophy of optic disc, central scotoma for light and colours; retinal congestion, arteries and veins tortuous; veins distended, arteries contracted; optic discs pale. Everything seemed in a fog; as if a spider's web over objects; green or red. One patient had complete right hemiplegia, following sudden loss of consciousness, blindness of right eye and great impairment of vision of left. Loss of memory, especially for words, was a very frequent symptom; delusions were common: "Heard voices and believed he had committed a robbery"; "sensation of a hole close by, into which he was in danger of falling." E. E. Case has cured with R[carbn-s]. 30 in a slender, nervous woman, the following symptoms: "Sensation, as of a weight between the scapulae, compelling her to bend forward. Throbbing in the dorsal spine as if a heart were beating there. Constipation with ineffectual urging to stool. Haemorrhage of bright blood from rectum after stool. Itching of anus after stool, also in the night. Feet swollen, hot and throbbing in the evening." R[carbn-s]. has the flatulency of 2[Carbo veg.] and the abdominal soreness of 2[Sulphur.] It produces eruptions of herpes and impetigo, discharges excoriating and producing violent itching. It corresponds to the herpetic diathesis. The pains are burning, tearing, jerking, and stitching and are apt to return at regular intervals for a long time. Pains come and go quickly. The periodicity shows itself, as in diarrhoea, which comes every six weeks. The B[<] from warmth common to R[carb-v]. and R[sulph]. shows itself in "Toothache brought on by warm food." Vision B[>] in evening; in twilight; after eating. B[<] From slightest motion; from walking. B[<] At night. Sleep is restless with tossing in bed. A feeling of vibration and trembling in whole body, particularly in hands. Anaesthesia of skin and mucous membranes.}
