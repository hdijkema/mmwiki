S{R[Ars-h] was used by Drysdale as a substitute for R[Ars] in the collapse stage of cholera. The symptoms set in suddenly but develop slowly. In poisoning cases death often took place in the second week, and one person, who recovered, suffered seven weeks. Though like R[Ars] in general symptoms, the gas has symptoms of its own. A striking case of sudden suppression of menses was cured with it after failure of R[Ars]}
