:rubric=Characteristics
S{I have already mentioned R[Macrin] under R[Cimic], from which it is derived; but as Dr. Scipio's proving (with the 3rd trit., from 9 to 24 grains being taken daily) brought out some features not noted in the R[Cimic] proving, I think it best to give it an independent mention.}

Retraction of head and neck. Neuralgic pains in limbs. Pulse 96; temperature 99°. The pain was relieved by R[Macrin] in a few hours and the flow came on.
