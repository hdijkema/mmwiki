:rubric=Characteristics.
S{I[Argentum] affects all the cartilages, and hence all joints and bones, with tearing and bruised pains, tenderness and weakness; painful, so-called "hysterical" joint, articular rheumatism without swelling; pain in rib cartilages and especially the left. Exostosis on skull. The muscular system is also affected with cramps in limbs; calves feel too short on going downstairs; stiffness; numbness; electric-like shocks in joints and limbs; painless twitchings. The heart is specially affected; frequent, spasmodic, though painless twitchings in whole heart muscle, B[<] lying on back; fears apoplexy. Sensation as if heart stood still followed by trembling, then irregular violent throbbing. Palpitation, at night; during pregnancy. Systemic convulsions. Epileptic attacks followed by delirious rage, jumping about, striking those near. In society disinclined to talk; discouraged. (Reaction from this: great inclination to talk, mind very clear.) Vertigo on entering a room after a walk. Vertigo on looking at running water. As if drunk. Frontal headache of business men. Headache increasing gradually and ceasing suddenly, at acme as if a nerve being torn, usually l. side. Viscidity of saliva and mucous expectoration, which is easy. From the mucous membranes generally there is secretion like boiled starch; or there may be thin and at the same time a thick yellow or greenish discharge. Great hunger even after a full meal. Extreme dryness of mouth, tongue sticks to palate. (This symptom with the polyuria points to diabetes, in which R[Arg] is particularly indicated if there is swelling of the ankles.) Spasmodic enuresis nocturna. Effects of onanism: impotence; atrophy of penis; bruised pains in testicles. Pains in left ovary; feels enormously swollen; with this, prolapse of uterus (scirrhus). Metrorrhagia, large lumps with violent pains, B[<] by every motion. R[Arg] acts more on the left side than the right; left ovary is affected: "Prolapsus uteri with pains in left ovary." It corresponds to deep-seated insidious disease. In the mental sphere it affects the intellect more than the affections. Headache of business men. Left-sided headache as if in brain substance. Headache and dyspepsia induced by mental agitation, nursing the sick, mental exertion. Suited to thin patients with hollow eyes, pale skin, tendency to tubercle, caries, cancer, deep ulcers, imbecility. The more deeply seated the troubles are the more likely are they to be painless. Tenderness is prominent in R[Arg] Tearing pressure and pains in the bones. Articular rheumatism without swelling. Parts feel bruised when pressed on. Hoarseness of singers and speakers, B[<] speaking or singing. Laughing causes cough. Restless sleep; electric shock through body wakens her. Symptoms B[<] in sleep; nausea in dreams; seminal emissions. On waking, limbs powerless. Paralytic weakness. B[<] By touch; pressure riding in carriage; lying on back; sitting; stooping. At noon at night (profuse urine). Uncovering (chills before midnight). Entering warm room. Sun}
