GT{Curara, Woorara. Woorali. Hoorali. Oorari. (An arrow poison used by South American Indians. Accounts differ as to its actual composition, into which the juice of different species of Strychnos are said to enter, or of Cocculus toxiferos with serpent poison. Others have said it is prepared from the venom of toads. In appearance it is something like the extract of liquorice. That used in C. Wesselhoeft's provings was obtained from Merck of Darmstadt.) N.

:rubric=Characteristics.
S{R[Cur] produces muscular paralysis, probably through its action on the nerve endings in the muscles, without affecting either the muscle substance or the nerve substance, and without impairing sensation and consciousness.} It is thus in many ways the opposite, in its action, of R[nux-v], though it is said to have the juice of a R[Stry] in its composition. It causes death by paralysis of the respiratory muscles. Reflex action is diminished or abolished (opp. R[nux-v]), and this is one great indication for its employment in homoeopathic practice. 

A cure of pseudo-hypertrophic paralysis by the 200th has been recorded. S{A condition resembling catalepsy has been induced by it; immobility with fixed gaze on waking.} S{Fetidity characterises many of the secretions and discharges.} 

Two cases of S{diabetes in middle-aged men} have been cured by Burkhardt with R[Cur] 4. 

S{It is suited to scrofulous children; producing scrofulous eruptions on skin, eczema, especially of face and behind ears; also liver-spots, yellow-brown.} S{It favours the formation of corns.} S{Debility short of paralysis indicates it; debility of the aged, and nervous debility from loss of fluids.} S{Its relation to hydrophobia and 2[tetanus] is probably antipathic.} S{It causes a sensation as if the brain were full of fluid.} S{Piercing, lancinating pains.} S{Throbbing pains.} S{Weakness; heaviness; numbness; numbness with tingling.} 

S{B[<] By movement; walking; ascending.} 
S{B[<] Dampness, cold air, cold weather, cold wind, change of weather.} 
S{B[<] 2 a.m. and 2-3 p.m.}
S{Many symptoms appear on right side.}
