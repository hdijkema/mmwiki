:rubric=Characteristics.
S{Burnett, following Hale, is our chief authority for 2[Ceanothus.] It has been recently proved by I. C. Fahnestock (2[Hom. News], March, 1900), but its place had already been made clear by clinical use; and definite clinical symptoms have been observed. 2[Ceanothus] is a spleen remedy 2[par excellence]; deep-seated pain in left hypochondrium; pain and fulness in left side; cutting pain. Pain, inflammation, enlargement of spleen, either alone or with other affections, indicate its use; chilliness, principally down back; shivering; rigors; must sit over fire; B[<] in cold weather. Low spirits with splenic affection. Headache, right side, with spleen pain. Diarrhoea and dysentery (compare 2[R[Casc]] and other Rhamneae) have been frequently observed in patients taking 2[Cean.] for spleen affections. Leucorrhoea, profuse, thick, yellow, with pain in left side; (I have frequently confirmed Burnett's experience in this last particular, as in most others, with this remedy.) P. C. Majumdar cured with 2[Cean.] 3x a case which had been diagnosed as one of heart-disease (there was palpitation and dyspnoea on exertion). Majumdar found the spleen enormously large. R. K. Ghosh has cured with it many cases of suppression of menses and leucorrhoea in patients from malarial districts. Menses too profuse and too early with pain in left side. Cannot lie down for pain in left side. Fahnestock's two provers took repeated doses of the Ã˜ tincture, and both had severe symptoms. One had had malaria five years before, treated with Quinine allopathically. This prover suffered more acutely than the other, and in the end had to be treated. R[nat-m]. 30 soon put an end to his symptoms. The other prover had practically identical symptoms but less severe. The symptoms of the provers are marked (F.) in the Schema.}
