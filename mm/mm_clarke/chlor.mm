:rubric=Characteristics.
S{2[Chlorum] has been proved in the form of "Chlorine water, and has been tested clinically. It produces spasms and convulsions, coryza and catarrh. Laryngeal spasm is especially pronounced; the chief difficulty is in 2[exhaling], can 2[draw in] the air well enough. Convulsive attacks on cutting eye-teeth. Mouth inflamed; ulcerated. Rapid emaciation. Acute rheumatic pains. Excessive sensitiveness of skin. Nettlerash, with fever. Cutis anserina. Skin dry, yellow, shrivelled. Malignant pustule and carbuncle. Typhoid state. The mental state is noteworthy. Fears he will go crazy; that he won't be able to make a living. Cannot remember names of people he sees, or if he sees the names cannot remember the person. E. Z. Bacon has recorded (2[Med. Visitor], Dec., 1893) two cases of chlorine poisoning. The first was in a boy of five, who, after passing through diphtheria to apparent complete recovery, was suddenly seized with symptoms of croup: loss of voice, crowing inspiration, prolonged expiration; incessant dry cough; great restlessness, high fever, profuse perspiration. The symptoms were B[<] lying on a lounge by the fire; B[>] when lying in his mother's lap, and still more relieved by being carried about. During the previous illness Platt's chlorides had been placed in the room as a disinfectant, and it occurred to the doctor that chlorine vapour is much heavier than air. He himself lay down on the lounge, and in a few minutes felt the irritating vapour, and began to cough and hack. This soon passed away on sitting up. The removal of the chlorides had a remarkable effect on the child; cough and respiration were greatly relieved. But the relief came too late, as the cause was not discovered for several days, during which time the patient had become steadily weaker, and he died the same afternoon. The other case was that of an old lady who suffered from chronic bronchitis, and on January 2, 1892, developed an attack of laryngitis. In three days she was well; but the two subsequent weeks, on exactly the same day, a fresh attack occurred. The fact was, as the doctor discovered, his patient went to the back room, where chlorides were kept, every Monday to wash a few things she did not care to send to the laundry. The chlorides were banished, and though the washing was continued there were no more attacks of laryngitis. Dr. Bacon adds, that since giving up the use of disinfectants, other than plenty of fresh air, he has never had laryngeal complications in scarlatina or diphtheria, though his neighbours have had plenty. Whitman recommends chlorine water as an efficient palliative in a fit of asthma. He begins with 10 drops, then in five minutes 20 more, and then in another five minutes, half-a-teaspoonful, always in a little water. It greatly facilitates expectoration. In typhus fever Goullon, senior, recommends chlorine water, five drops every two or three hours until the tongue is dry. I have had excellent results from the 12th and 30th in nasal catarrh, and in breathlessness remaining after acute bronchitis. The symptoms are B[<] from midnight to 7 a.m. (spasm of glottis). Lying down B[<] nasal complaints. Inclination to lie down, with headache. Restless; B[<] walking up and down. Sitting with sun shining on back 2[=] shuddering. Open air B[>] chest affections; 2[=] running of tears. Damp air 2[=] loss of voice.}
