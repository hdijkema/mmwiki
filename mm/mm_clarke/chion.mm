:rubric=Characteristics.
S{R[chion] acts powerfully on the liver and is indicated in hypertrophy; obstructed liver in malarious districts. The following are the leading indications: Enormous liver, constipation, clay-coloured stool, jaundice, and high-coloured urine. Liver region sore. Chronic jaundice. Jaundice recurring every summer. Sensation of contraction of stomach as if something alive moving in it; with uneasy sensation in liver and spleen. Rheumatic pains in left ankle and tarsal bone. A proving of R[chion] was made by Dr. John Z. Lawshe, and was communicated, with additions, to the 2[Southern Journal of Homoeopathy] by H. C. Morrow. R[chion] is suited to so-called bilious temperaments. One observer (2[H. Recorder], xii. 369), who gave R[chion]. to a nursing woman who had liver disorder with jaundiced tint, noticed that whilst rapid improvement of the liver symptoms occurred, at the same time the milk disappeared and the menses returned. The medicine was stopped and R[sabal]. given and the milk returned. Six weeks later R[chion]. was again given and identically the same result took place. "jaundice with arrest of menses" should be a strong indication.} S{Sherbino cured a case of neurasthenia in a clergyman who complained of: Perspiration all summer. Weakness in arms and legs. Prostrated after preaching mind: ran on sermon and kept him awake. Stupid, drowsy all the time appetite poor; all food gave distress.}
