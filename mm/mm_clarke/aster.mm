:rubric=Characteristics.
S{The star-fish was used by Hippocrates in uterine diseases. This shows its pathogenetic relationship to R[Sep] and R[Murx]. It is also an ancient remedy for epilepsy. It powerfully affects the mind and head, producing symptoms strongly suggesting apoplexy. The face is red, and there is strong congestion to the head, which is hot and feels as if surrounded with hot air. Certain forms of cerebral congestion with obstinate constipation. Electric shocks in the head. Nightly lancinating pains in the breasts have led to its successful use in cases of mammary cancer. Petroz used R[Aster] successfully in old skin affections, old ulcers, and in cancers. He found that it only acted on the latter when on the 2[left] side. (I have a case} S{probably not cancerous} S{of tumour of the left breast, diminishing under this remedy; but I have also seen it act well on the right breast). Sexual desire increased, sexual excitement. A pushing-out sensation in womb, impeding walking, recalling R[Sep] H. C. Allen mentions it as a remedy for acne having small puncta with black tips and small red bases. Symptoms are B[<] at night; by motion, and in cold, damp weather. Tears B[>] the mental state. Teste says the malaise is B[<] by heat. Great desire for cold drinks Coffee B[<] all the symptoms, and excites them anew several days after they have disappeared. R[Aster] is a very important remedy too seldom used.}
