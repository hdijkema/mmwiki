:rubric=Characteristics.
S{Gold affects profoundly the entire organism, exercising a solvent action on the tissues, producing ulcerations and the disappearances of new growths. Hence it is one of the best antidotes to Mercurial over-dosing, and especially in cases of syphilis. Scrofula and caries of bone also find in R[Aur] a remedy. It also produces rushes of blood and haemorrhages. Boring pains and burning stitches predominate. No drug produces more acute mental depression than R[Aur], and in any case where this profound melancholy is found, Aurum must be well studied. There is a condition of melancholy, hoplessness, profound depression, tendency to suicide and longing for death. Anthrophobia. Aggravation from emotion. Complaints after grief, fright, anger, disappointed love, contradiction, reserved displeasure. Hysteria, laughs and cries alternately. The head is giddy, full, hot. Rush of blood to the head. Vertigo as if turning in a circle when stooping, goes off on rising. As if drunk when walking in the open air. Sensation as if a current of air were rushing through the head, if not kept warm. Bones of skull painful, especially lying down. Vertical half-sight. Fiery sparks. Caries of mastoid process of bones of nose. Ozaena. In the abdominal region, as with R[Merc], there is swelling of liver, jaundice. Hernia, inguinal or umbilical; and in children. Onanism. The sexual organs are markedly affected. Induration of testes. Undeveloped testicles in puny boys. Swelling or neuralgia of testicle (r). Uterus prolapsed and indurated; the weight of it causes prolapse. (The chloride of gold and sodium acts more powerfully in these conditions.) Shelton has recorded as effects on girls working with gold leaf the occurrence of a "thick leucorrhoeal discharge, not offensive, white or yellowish, occasionally profuse, invariably B[<] by walking." Suffocative attacks, with suffocative oppression of chest. Anxious palpitation from congestion to the chest. Palpitation, with anguish and tremulous fearfulness. Pain in heart region extending down left arm to fingers. There are boring pains in bones, B[<] at night. Over-sensitiveness to all pain. Hysterical spasms, with laughing and crying alternately. Great ebullitions with congestion to the head and chest, and palpitation of the heart. Frightful dreams; he sobs aloud when asleep. Chilliness predominates; shivering in open air; coldness of hands and feet, sometimes lasting all night. Heat, only in the face. Perspiration in the morning hours; mostly on and around the genitals. Ulcers which attack the bones. Warts, scrofulous, syphilitic, mercurial. "B[<] From Sunset to sunrise" is a leading Condition of R[Aur] Paralytic drawing in the limbs in the morning when awaking; and on getting cold. B[<] At night; in morning; on getting cold; by rest. Shivering on getting into bed. B[>] Moving; walking; getting warm. Suited to sanguine people with black hair and dark eyes, olive-brown complexion. Also light-haired scrofulous persons. Pining boys, girls at puberty, and old age. Syphilitic and mercurial patients.}
