:rubric=Characteristics.
S{The effects of I[Angustura] are closely allied to those of R[Nux-v], R[Ruta], and R[Merc]. The mental condition is one of over-sensitiveness and excitability; the slightest offence, a mere trifle, irritates as with R[Nux-v] On the other hand there is pusillanimity, which corresponds more to R[Ruta] Among the prominent features are: Drawing, tension, stiffness of muscles and joints; bruised, sore feeling as after a blow. Drawing of head to right side, later to left. Shortsighted. Heat in forehead at night. Exostosis of lower jaw. Trismus neonatorum (where much R[Merc] had been given). Drawing in upper r. molar tooth B[>] application of cold finger. Thirst, constant desire to drink. Irresistible desire to drink coffee. Hiccough after cough. Belching with cough (R[Ambr]). Every evacuation followed by shivering, crawling sensation over face. Tenesmus with soft stool. Hæmorrhoids protrude with hard, knotty stool. Seminal emissions. Itching of tip of glans penis (when walking in open air). Violent itching on scrotum. Dry, hacking cough from scratching in throat or irritation behind sternum. Irritation behind sternum through to back. Palpitation B[<] sitting bent and B[>] sitting up. Cutting pain from point of right scapula to breast, near nipple (R[Chel]). Pain in cervical vertebræ B[<] moving arms. Tearing as if in the bones, B[<] at rest; B[>] cold applications; B[>] extension; B[<] exertion and pressure. Spinal cord and extensor muscles principally affected; cracking in all joints. Caries of long bones. I have verified the power of R[Ang] over long bones in a case of acute periostitis of the tibia in a scrofulous boy. The 5x trit. speedily arrested inflammation, after the failure of R[Merc-v] Symptoms B[<] from exertion; from stooping; sitting bent over (palpitation) moving or lifting arms; drinking warm milk; 3 p.m. (loose cough); >[application] of cold fingers (toothache); cold application; extension; lying on left side}
