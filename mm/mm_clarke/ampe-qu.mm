:rubric=Characteristics.
S{Our pathogenetic knowledge of R[Ampe-qu] is due to observations on two children poisoned by chewing the leaves. They were quickly seized with violent vomiting and purging, with considerable tenesmus; then collapse, sweating, and faint pulse; then deep sleep for two hours, from which they were aroused by return of vomiting and purging. There was dilatation of pupil for hours after commencement of attack}

S{Hansen gives as an indication: "Chronic hoarseness inpatients who were scrofulous in their youth." S. M. Worthington has cured with it renal dropsies that had resisted other treatment and a case of hydrocele. He found the decoction the most efficient preparation}
