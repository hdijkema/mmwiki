:rubric=Characteristics.
S{R[carb-an]. is suited to old persons, greatly debilitated, especially when there is venous plethora, and blueness of skin. Complaints occurring in scrofulous or venous constitutions. Ulceration, gangrene, and decomposition are marked, and may be looked upon as the counterpart of the antiseptic properties of the crude substance. Copper-coloured eruptions show the appropriateness of the drug to many cases of constitutional syphilis. Glands of stony hardness. Buboes. It is often indicated in the last stage of pneumonias, bronchitis, phthisis. Right chest is most affected. Cancer of breast with burning, drawing pains through breast. Cancer of uterus, burning pains down thigh. Affections from loss of animal fluids, especially nursing women. Weakness of nursing women; can hardly walk across the room. "Gone" feeling from loss of fluids. Too weak to eat. Weeps when she eats. Nausea at night. Hunger in early morning. The goneness of R[carb-an]. is not B[>] by eating (R[carb-v]. B[>] eating). Constipation where patient thinks bowels will be moved but only wind passes. There is a smothering feeling on closing eyes. Aversion to dark. A peculiar symptom is: A feeling of looseness} S{of eyes in sockets; of brain on motion or coughing. Far-sighted (R[carb-v]. is near-sighted). Objects seem farther apart and brighter. Aversion to cold (R[carb-v]. to heat). There are many sensations of coldness: in chest; about stomach. Discharges are ichorous; but the discharge from piles is inodorous. R[carb-an]. 3x trit. has been used for insufflation in aural polypi. The leucorrhoea stains linen yellow. Sweat stains yellow. Expectoration is greenish, purulent, offensive (R[carb-v]. yellow, more fetid). Gnawing pains in tibiae (during the night), such as usually followed cold feet. A. W. K. Choudhury reports a case of cough of two years' duration, in an unhealthy boy of twelve, cured by R[carb-an]. The symptoms were: "Cough evening and morning, or 2[after lying down], especially at 2[night], thick or frothy whitish or yellowish sputa, sweetish when thick; B[<] lying on r. side; B[<] from exposure to air, to which he is very sensitive. Great tendency to catch cold." The pains in the coccyx are peculiar; a dragging, bruised pain, when touched it becomes burning. It has cured many cases of injured coccyx and of neuralgia of the bone. The lumbago of R[carb-an]. occurs when walking, standing, and lying; feels as if the back were broken. The mental state is one of low spirits, sadness; weeps when she eats; easily frightened, afraid in the dark; home-sick; wants to be alone. Fear of the dark and B[<] on closing eyes is very marked. Hearing is confused; cannot tell the direction from which sounds come. There is an ichorous otorrhoea; and swelling of the periosteum over the mastoid bone is very characteristic. Tip of nose red; or blue. Disagreeable smoothness of the teeth. There is a hoarse, suffocating cough producing a shaking of the brain as if it were loose. Green, purulent, horribly offensive expectoration. Axillary glands inflamed buboes in groins. Pressure with hand B[>] coldness of stomach. Symptoms are B[<] in cold air; B[>] in warm room. B[<] From sprains from touch. B[<] After shaving. Rest B[<] head symptoms. B[<] Lying on r. side (cough). After menses, throbbing headache, B[<] in open air. Weakness B[<] during menses.}
