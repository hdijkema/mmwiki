:rubric=Characteristics.
S{The I[Nitrite of Amyl] was introduced into medicine by the old school as a remedy for angina pectoris, and was supposed to act by lessening arterial tension. Dr. G. W. Balfour has, however, shown that this cannot always be the case, since samples which have been kept for a time in imperfectly sealed bottles, whilst retaining their power to relax tension, have none over the pain. Homœopathic provings have shown that in some cases at any rate R[Aml-n] has a specific action. The most striking action of the drug is the deep facial flushing it causes and the pulsation all over the body. The specific heart symptoms are: Sensation of swelling of front of chest as if convex, with a feeling as if the lower end of the sternum made a deep depression bent in towards the spine. Precordial anxiety. Accelerated, intensified beating at the heart. Oppression and tumultuous action. Constriction (relieved by R[Cact]) and aching pain. Strong, full pulse. Other prominent symptoms are: Anxiety as if something might happen; must have fresh air. Throbbing in head. Bursting-out feeling in ears. Smacking of lips as if in act of tasting. Munching movement of lower jaw as if chewing. Constriction of throat and heart from actual fright ran to window for air. Intense fulness in head sensation of rushing to vertex. Eyes protruding, staring. Exophthalmic goître from grief. Flushing of face. Flushing on least emotion. Nash has cured with it "chronic blushing on least excitement mental or physical." Heat, redness, turgidity. Choking feeling; collar feels tight. Tremor and weakness of limbs. B[>] Open-air exercise; cold water and cold air. B[<] In warm room}
