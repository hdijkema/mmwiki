:rubric=Characteristics.
It was the use of R[Arg-n] in olden times in the treatment of epilepsy which led to the production of the lamentable cases of lead-coloured pigmentation of the skin called Argyria. Homoeopathic experience has proved the applicability of the drug to many cases of epilepsy and the needlessness of employing a dosage that entails any risk whatever. 

S{The cases of epilepsy calling for this drug are those caused by fright, or occurring at the menstrual period.} 
S{For days or hours before the attack the pupils are dilated, and after the attack the patient is very restless and has trembling of the hands.} 

Among the leading symptoms of R[arg-n]. are: 


S{Great tremor.}
S{Nervous feeling; sensation as if being squeezed in a vice.}
S{Feeling of constriction in various parts as of a band of iron round chest or waist.}
S{A feeling as if the body or some part of the body were expanding.} 


S{Migraine, with feeling as if head were enormously enlarged; B[>] tightly bound.}


S{Defective co-ordination.}
S{Paralyses of motion and sensation; a peculiar numbness accompanied with hyperaesthesia.} 



S{Sensation of a splinter sticking in various parts.}
S{Burning sensations.}

Gowers has recorded a case in which the use of R[arg-n]. for stomach trouble caused (like lead), drop-wrist, gout, and albuminuria. In allopathic practice the dyspepsia for which it is given is B[<] before food, when the stomach is empty. The opposite condition is the leading indication in homoeopathic practice.

E. P. Brewer (I[Hahn. Monthly], July, 1883) has recorded a proving, (the prover, a young man, taking on three consecutive days one grain a day of R[arg-n]. triturated with sugar of milk), in which a number of motor and sensory symptoms were elicited, reminding Dr. Brewer of locomotor ataxy, in which it has been used with success by old-school practitioners. This use also has led to many cases of argyria.

Among the symptoms of this proving were: "S{Mental operations sluggish; continued thought required special effort, but exertion of mind did not aggravate the heaviness and fulness of head.} S{Lower extremities (loins, sacrum, and particularly gastrocnemii) fatigued; as if they would suddenly fail him.} S{Loss of ambition.} 
S{Building air castles by day: monstrous dreams by night.}
S{" Another peculiar symptom was: chilly down the back beginning close to occiput extending to extreme tip of coccyx at noon every day; B[>] by warmth; at 5 p.m.}
S{chills subsided, no sweat, but profound sleepiness, without sleep but enchanted with vivid imagination: burning heat followed.}
S{There was burning in one spot in front of rectum, probably in prostate gland.}
S{Micturition more frequent, burning in urethra.}
S{The headache was B[>] by R[cimic].} 


In a proving by myself one of the most marked symptoms was S{a kind of numb sensitiveness of the skin of the arms.} S{A hyperaesthetic-anaesthetic state, increased sensitiveness to contact, but diminished power of distinguishing sensations.}


S{Other symptoms were sore throat with white patches, rheumatic pains in (left) wrist (which I have since confirmed), and finger joints, with external tenderness of bony prominences, pain on rising in right sacro-iliac notch.} S{Soreness of muscles of neck and back.} S{Urticarious spots in various parts.} 


S{In poisoning cases complete loss of consciousness, insensibility, and convulsions have occurred.} 


S{Some of the notable digestive symptoms are: "Irresistible desire for sugar."} S{"Fluids go right through him."} S{Belching accompanies most gastric affections.} 


S{Green stools are remarkable.} S{"Green mucus like chopped spinach in flakes."} S{"Stool turning green after remaining on diaper."} S{"Stool expelled with much spluttering."} S{"Stool shreddy, red, green muco-lymph or epithelial substance."} 


S{There is a pain in the small of the back, B[>] on standing or walking, but severe when rising from a seat. (R[sulph]., R[Caust].)} 


S{R[arg-n]. has irresistible desire for sugar, which at the same time B[<].} 

:div-begin=quote
Kent relates a case illustrating this. A nursing infant had a grass-green diarrhoea which failed to yield to R[merc]., R[Ars]. , and R[cham]. At last Kent discovered that the mother ate a pound of candy a day. R[arg-n]. was given and the candy stopped and the child soon got well.
