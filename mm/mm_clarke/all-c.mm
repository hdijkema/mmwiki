:rubric=Characteristics.
S{R[All-c] covers more symptoms of common cold than any other remedy, as the well-known effect of onions in producing tears would suggest. It will cure a large proportion of cases of cold in the head, but the conditions which most particularly indicate it are: Cough, or cold, or headache 2[< ]in warm room, 2[> ]in open air, 2[< ]again on returning to warm room. It causes burning of eyelids, nose, mouth, throat, bladder, skin. Inflammation and increased secretion of mucous membranes: neuralgic pains like a 2[long thread;] in face, head, neck, and elsewhere; 2[< ]evening; towards ear from deep within head. The toothache of R[All-c] is 2[> ]by cold air or cold washing. It is suited to traumatic neuritis. Hurts do not heal. The feet are easily galled by walking. It was recommended by Dioscorides as a remedy for this condition, and homśopathy has confirmed his observation. Desire for raw onions is an indication for it. Thread-like pains are common in various parts and are characteristic of R[All-c]. Thread-like pains in face. Left-side facial paralysis has been cured by R[All-c] The cough of R[All-c] is caused by tickling in larynx; constant inclination to hack in order to relieve it. It has cured violent catarrhal laryngitis; hoarse cough with feeling as if it would split and tear the larynx, causing watering of eyes. Cough from inhaling cold air. R[All-c] has yawning and drowsiness. A raw onion eaten just before going to bed is a popular remedy for sleeplessness. R[All-c] is a left-side medicine primarily. Symptoms go from left to right. Left eye; left facial paralysis; left inguinal ring. Rest 2[<;] motion 2[>.] 2[< ]Afternoon and evening; when lying down. Damp cold wind and weather 2[= ]colds and toothache. But cold water and open air 2[>;] warm room 2[< ]Picking or sucking teeth 2[> ]toothache. Eyes sensitive to touch}
