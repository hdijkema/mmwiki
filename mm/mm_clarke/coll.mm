:rubric=Characteristics.
S{R[Coll] is native to North America. It has a very tough, hard, knotted root. It has been proved twice, first by Burt and later by Dowla. The former took the tincture, the latter the powder. Both experienced headache, the former in connection with abdominal and rectal disturbance, the latter with flushing, sensation of heat, numbness, feeling of enlargement. The legs felt light, as if he could run like a deer. R[Nux-v] relieved the sensations, the symptoms passing off from above downwards. In Dr. Burt's case the symptoms generally passed from above downwards. As a domestic remedy, and among the eclectics, it is known as a remedy for chronic catarrhal conditions, especially of stomach, bowels, and bladder; also of nose, pharynx, and larynx, and in tubular and capillary bronchitis. It is, according to Hammond, "a stimulant, a most valuable tonic, a positive diuretic and mild laxative." Hammond also commends it in the palpitation of the menopause. F. S. Smith mentions that it has a domestic reputation in rheumatism. He records a case (subacute) in a woodsman of 30. It began in foot and ankle, and travelled over nearly every joint in the body. A few drops of R[coll]. Ã˜ was mixed in a tumbler of water, and a teaspoonful given every two hours. Rapid cure resulted. He utters a caution against using low potencies where there is organic heart affections. It is useful in heart affections alternating with suppressed haemorrhoidal bleeding; sensitiveness about the heart, fulness, oppressed breathing, faintness. Dewey mentions that it cured a case in which there was severe constrictive pain about the heart in a man who habitually passed blood by stool, the heart symptoms coming on when the bleeding ceased, and disappearing when it was re-established. R[coll]. cured both. It has cured inveterate cases of dyspepsia with weight in epigastrium and piles.} S{Neuralgia and rheumatic pains were experienced by the provers in many parts: upper jaw, arms, hands, knees, joints. The greatest number of Dr. Burt's symptoms were experienced in the bowels and rectum: Pains in umbilicus and hypogastrium, constipation with hard light stools, great straining, faintness; stools of mucus and blood. These symptoms suggested the use of the remedy in cases of piles, where it has proved most efficacious. Piles during the catamenia. Prolapse of the rectum with piles. The heart was markedly affected: irritation of cardiac nerves; palpitation, faintness, oppression. Nash has cured cases of the most obstinate constipation with R[coll]. In one there was severe colic, which had recurred for several years, the concomitant symptoms being great flatulence and haemorrhoidal troubles. He differentiates between 2[R[Aesc]] and R[coll]. (both of which have sensation as if rectum was full of sticks) thus: 2[R[Aesc]] has sense of 2[fulness in rectum], which R[coll]. has not. 2[R[Aesc]] piles do not bleed as a rule; those of R[coll]. bleed persistently, 2[R[Aesc]] has pain, soreness, and aching in the back ![and, I may add, B[<] by walking.} S{J. H. C.]. R[coll]. has more persistently constipation, with colic on account of it. 2[R[Aesc]] may have constipation or may not. R[coll]. has shown marked power of disturbing the circulation and causing haemorrhages, and also of disturbing cutaneous sensation. The symptoms are B[<] evening and night, and B[>] in morning. B[<] By slightest emotion or excitement.}
