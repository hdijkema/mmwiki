:rubric=Characteristics.
S{The symptoms of I[Anilinum] have been observed on workpeople poisoned by inhalation of the fumes, and on persons who have worn aniline-dyed articles next the skin. The symptoms are in many respects like those of R[Ars]. There are vomiting, purging, bursting headache, epileptiform attacks; cyanosis is very marked; swelling and irritation of the skin. In old-school practice injections of aniline blue have been used with some success to destroy cancerous growths, aniline having a marked affinity for cell nuclei, hence its use in staining microscopic specimens. In poisoning cases evacuants, the inhalation of oxygen, the free use of stimulants} S{brandy, ammonia, chloric ether} S{cold affusions to the head, and t[sinapisms|mosterdpleisters] on legs and thighs, have been used with success}
