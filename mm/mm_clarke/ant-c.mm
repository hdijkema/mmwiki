:rubric=Characteristics.
S{I[Antim. crud.] corresponds in a sense to the race of swine, as Arsenic does to horses and R[Puls] to sheep. It is preeminently a scrofulous medicine, corresponding to gross constitutions with tendency to rough scaling skin with horny patches. With these horny patches is great tenderness, the patient can hardly bear to walk on them. Analagous to these horny excrescences are warts, and R[Ant-c] has cured many cases of these. A student, 17, had twenty-three on right hand and thirty four on left, mainly on backs and fingers, but a few on interior surface of fingers. In addition redness and inflammation of eyelids. Cured in seven weeks with R[Ant-c] 200x. In the same category may be mentioned the tendency of the nails to grow in splits. R[Ant-c] is specially suited to infants and children (with coated moist white tongues) and also to elderly persons. Tendency to grow fat. When symptoms recur they change their locality or go from one side of the body to the other. Left side predominates, especially lower left and upper right. Among special symptoms are: Itching of scalp and falling out of hair. Tendency to take cold about head. Scrofulous ophthalmia, canthi especially affected (R[Graph] the whole margin). Otorrhœa. Moist eruption behind ears (R[Graph]). Slight noises startle. Nose-bleed with vertigo; after headache; after rush of blood to head. Children are peevish, won't bear to be touched or looked at. Adults are sulky or sad. Weeping and impressionable. Sentimental mood by moonlight. Amativeness. Suicidal. Gastric and remittent fevers, and fevers of children, with great thirst and the characteristic white tongue. The fever runs higher at night. The child is cross, but unlike the R[Cham] patient, who wants to be carried, this will scream and show temper at every little attention. There is a form of diarrhœa which alternates with constipation, often found in old people, to which R[Ant-c] corresponds. "Stomach weak, digestion easily disturbed, in old people." It cures many cases of mucous piles: continuous oozing, staining linen. In connection with the intolerance of wine of the remedy, it may be mentioned that in one case it produced a feeling of intoxication like that of alcohol, so that the patient refused to take any more of it. A number of nervous symptoms appear in the provings} S{restlessness, jerking of muscles, etc. Dr. M. Jousset has recorded a severe case of chorea which resisted all the usual remedies and was cured with R[Ant-c] prescribed on the digestive symptoms, particularly the characteristic white tongue. A notable characteristic of R[Ant-c] is the thickly coated tongue. Generally it is thick and white; milky-white; or like whitewash evenly laid. The edges may be red and sore. Sore, cracked and crusty nostrils and corners of mouth. Abnormal hunger; not relieved by eating; emptiness at epigastrium and want of animal heat. Disgust for all foods. Nursing children throw up a little sour milk as soon as they take the breast or bottle (R[Aeth], after vomiting the child sleeps and wakes hungry; R[Ant-c] the child refuses to nurse again). The sulphur element in R[Ant-c] is strongly pronounced in the provings as in the constipation and other intestinal disorders of the drug. B[<] By heat is a marked characteristic (2[R[Apis], R[Puls], R[Cham], R[Sec], R[Camph]]); also B[<] from cold washing (less severe after warm washing), from cold water and cold food. In spite of the B[<] from heat there is great sensitiveness to cold, hence it is suitable to the hydrogenoid constitutions. Moonlight B[<] mental symptoms. Many symptoms are B[<] at night. B[<] By touch. B[<] From wine, especially sour wine; from vinegar and acids (though tamarind water does not disagree); from fruits. B[<] From pork, bread, and pastry. B[>] By rest, by lying down; B[<] rising up; B[<] ascending stairs}
