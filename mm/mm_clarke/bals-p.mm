:rubric=Characteristics.
S{Peruvian Balsam has been chiefly used empirically in catarrhal phthisis or bronchial catarrh with copious purulent expectoration. Sputa thick, creamy, yellowish white; loud r√¢les, night sweats, hectic. Hale has used it with success in "chronic, purulent, fetid anterior or posterior nasal catarrh, with or without ulceration." He says that a cerate of the R[Bals-p] is the best application next to 2[Glycerole of Aloes] for indolent ulcers, cracked nipples, cracks in fingers and palmer surfaces of hands, or fissured and chapped lips. The R[Bals-p] is also used externally for killing the acarus of itch. All parts affected are gently rubbed with it at night and a bath taken in the morning. A single application is sufficient. It has been proved by Lembke.}
