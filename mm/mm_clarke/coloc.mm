:rubric=Characteristics.
S{"The strongest characteristic calling for the use of this remedy is an agonising pain in the abdomen causing the patient to bend over double. Relief is obtained by motion, such as twisting, turning and wriggling around, and the motion is kept up steadily while the pain lasts; the pain is B[<] by eating or drinking the least amount. This pain may occur alone, or in the dysentery, cholera, etc. The doubling over of the patient is the chief characteristic" (Guernsey). The patient bends double or presses something hard against the abdomen. He leans over chairs, the table, or bedposts to get relief. According to Nash R[Mag-p] comes nearest to it in colic and neuralgic affections. R[cham]. is also very close, both having colic from disturbing emotions, but the R[cham]. child does not double up, it tosses about. The R[staph]. patient is likely to have black or decayed teeth and sore eyelids, and there is chronic tendency to colic. R[verat]. has colic B[>] bending double, but it has also cold sweat. R[Dios] has wind colic, but is B[>] by stretching out. The R[stann]. child wants to be carried with the abdomen on the mother's shoulder.} S{The nearest analogue to R[Coloc] in its entire action on the human body is its botanical congener R[bry], with which it should be compared. Both have the same general features} S{pain in muscles, nerves, and joints, gastro-enteric disturbance, and the same condition in regard to rheumatic joints, B[<] by movement. Both have great irritability and ailments from mental emotion, though the latter feature is more marked in R[coloc]. Arthritis and gouty headaches with ophthalmia, facial neuralgic pains extending to eye.} S{2[R[coloc].] has diarrhoea from grief, indignation or chagrin. Suppressed lochia from indignation. Diabetes with milky, gelatinous, or colloid urine. The characteristic griping of R[coloc]., forcing the patient to bend double, may be accompanied by cramps in other parts, which may occur with or without stool; if a stool occurs it gives immediate relief (R[nux-v] the opposite); any attempt to eat or drink 2[<.] Cramps occur in the legs, uterus, and ovaries. A sensation as if clamped with iron bands is very characteristic in (coxalgia; dysmenia, etc.). Dragging in uterus and vagina. Griping, cutting, tearing, and spasmodic pains in the body; burning pains; pulsations through the body; sensation as of hard stones or potatoes in the body. Easily intoxicated by stimulants. Affections of right side generally. The pains are often accompanied by stiffness and retarded motion of the affected parts; often affect the hip-joints; pains affecting joints are much B[<] by motion; many neuralgic pains are B[>] by rest. Abdominal pains are B[>] by violent exertion. B[>] Lying with head bent forward. Rheumatic pain in the limbs is B[>] by discharge of flatus. Touch B[<], and pressure B[>] many of the pains. Warmth B[>] most pains. B[<] Evening and night. R[coloc]. has, like 2[R[lyc]., R[hell].], and R[caust]., a 4 p.m. aggravation. One prover had: "At 4 p.m. the colic came on, six days in succession." This has been verified clinically. R[coloc]. is suited to blondes; persons of choleric temperament; and those liable to cramps and colic, from fruit, lead-poisoning, or excessive venery.}
