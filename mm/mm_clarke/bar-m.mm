:rubric=Characteristics.
S{The symptoms of 2[Baryta mur.] are like those of the other Barium salts, but it has a distinct character of its own. Convulsions are more marked in the muriate. Periodical attacks of convulsions, with excessive jactitation of the limbs. Idiocy. Mania, with increase of sexual desire; "in every form of mania as soon as the sexual desire is increased." Offensive otorrhoea. Parotid glands hard and swollen (especially right). It has cured whizzing and buzzing in ears; noises on chewing and swallowing. Deafness. Great salivation and odour from mouth as from mercurialisation. Swelling of salivary glands. Disposition to tonsillitis. There is great indigestion. Below stomach to left a hardness from which paroxysms of dyspnoea come. Induration of pancreas. Distressing throbbing in abdomen (abdominal aneurism). Many cases of aneurism have been benefited by 2[Bar. mur.] Both elements have a strong action on heart and arteries. In one poisoning case, that of a girl, the instant she swallowed the solution she exclaimed that she was on fire; vomitings, convulsions, pain in the head and complete deafness supervened; and death within an hour. 2[Baryt. mur.] acts on parotid glands and pancreas. Is suited to scrofulous children. Attacks of tonsillitis occurring in spring and autumn. The earache is B[>] by sipping cold water.}
