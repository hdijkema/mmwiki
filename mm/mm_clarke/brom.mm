:rubric=Characteristics.
S{R[Brom] forms a leading constituent in the mineral waters of Kreutzach and Woodhall. It is a predominantly left-side medicine. It affects particularly the internal head, left side. It is suited to blue-eyed, fair people (opp. R[Iod]), especially children with thin, white, delicate skins, and very light hair and eyebrows (patients with dark hair are not excluded); to scrofulous constitutions. The glands (thyroid, testes, maxillary, parotid) are swollen and indurated. There is much anxiety of mind; a fear of ghosts or visions when in the dark. Like the other Halogens, R[Brom] is a strong anti-scorbutic. It has B[>] at the sea-side (opp. R[Nat-m]); but B[<] in sailors when coming ashore. Migraine chiefly left side, B[<] from stooping, especially after drinking milk. It has a peculiar vertigo: sensation deep in brain as if vertigo would come on; tendency to fall backward; B[<] at the sight of running water; or if he put his foot on a bridge; B[<] in damp weather. Vertigo with nose-bleed. Soreness and crusts inside nose. Nose-bleed accompanies many affections, especially of chest. There is a peculiar headache with coryza. In the cases of diphtheria indicating it the disease begins in the larynx and runs up. In croup, with all the croupy sound, there is much loose rattling in larynx with the breathing and coughing, 2[but no choking in the cough, as there is in Hepar] (Guernsey). Tuberculosis, especially of right lung. Hypertrophy of the heart and palpitation. Pain in heart going up to axilla. A very peculiar symptom is: loud emissions of air from the vagina. Symptoms are B[<] by cold air; cold water; cold diet; cold damp weather; heat of sun. The cough is B[<] entering warm room. Headache B[<] from drinking milk; from stooping. Complaints are better at sea-side; sailors coming ashore suffer from asthma, which is relieved when they go to sea again. Symptoms B[<] evening till midnight; when at rest; B[>] riding on horseback. After dinner feels he will have an attack of apoplexy. Exertion 2[=] oppression at heart.}
