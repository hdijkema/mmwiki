:rubric=Characteristics.
S{We are indebted to Rubini of Naples and his devoted wife for the first provings of this great remedy. R[Cact] affects powerfully the entire organism, but its intensest operation is on the heart and circulation. In congestive violence it rivals R[Acon], which is one of its antidotes. As with R[Acon], too, the pains are unendurable; they extort screams. Sadness, apprehension, fear of death and a tendency to be easily frightened characterise the R[Cact] mental state, as they do many conditions of heart disease. Given as an organ-remedy it will benefit a large number of cases of weakened and painful heart; and if its keynote symptom of constriction} S{"as if an iron band prevented its normal movements," or "heart as if compressed violently and as violently struggled to burst its bonds"} S{is present, it will cure. Pain and numbness in left arm accompanying heart disease. Sharp pains in diaphragm and girdle pain round its attachment. Indigestion with these symptoms. Snader considers R[Cact] specially indicated where the heart is weak and the arteries atheromatous. This is confirmed by a venerable correspondent of the 2[Hom. World] (July, 1898), who, finding his temporal arteries much swollen and hard to touch, took several doses of R[Cact] 1x, with the result that in a few days they became normal. Snader uses the lower attenuations in this condition. A case of angina pectoris was cured by the 30th, with the following characteristic: sensation as though a swarm of hornets were going from pectoral region to heart. R[Cact] has the weakness and coldness of the extremities which characterise many heart cases, and render it an appropriate remedy. Constricting pains run through the pathogenesis (throat; chest; heart; bladder; rectum; vagina). Twitching of muscles, and sensation of constriction produced by touching the affected part. Haemorrhages (nose; lungs; rectum; stomach). Sanguineous congestions, which are in a way a counter-part of the constrictive sensations. Prostration. Among the other prominent symptoms of R[Cact] are: "Heavy pain in vertex, like a weight." "Periodical attacks of suffocation, with fainting, cold sweat on face, and loss of pulse." "Fluttering and palpitation of heart, B[<] when walking or lying on left side." "Heart disease with swelling of left hand only." "Numbness of left arm." "Rheumatism of all joints, beginning in upper extremities." The pains are very sharp, causing the patient to cry out. Many symptoms are B[<] at night ("2[Night-]blooming Cereus"). Menses cease at night. Many symptoms B[<] lying down, or come on when lying down. Periodicity is well marked (quotidian fever, 11 a.m.). Chill at same hour every day, 11 a.m. or 11 p.m. Choudhury has reported a case cured, the characteristics being: "Chill severe, 11 a.m., thirsty, headache, body hot; no separate heat." When there is heat there is thirst and short breath. At times there is entire absence of sweat. There is B[<] after eating (weight at stomach); and also B[<] from missing a meal or fasting (prosopalgia and other neuralgias); B[<] from lying on left side; from noise and light from heat; from sun's rays; from exertion; from damp.}
