GT{Aconitine. Aconitia. C33 H45 NO12. An alkaloid obtained from the roots and stems of Aconitum napellus. It is contained in all species of Aconite except A. lycoctonum}

S{![German Aconitine is amorphous; French Aconitine is crystalline, and 170 times stronger than the German. Morson's "English Aconitine" is a secret preparation believed to be made from A. Ferox. The alkaloid in A. Ferox differs somewhat from ordinary Aconitine chemically, and is called pseudo-Aconitine. Aconitine of T. H. Smith, of Edinburgh, is probably identical with Morson's. Symptoms from Morson's are marked (M) in the Schema.]}

:rubric=Characteristics.
S{Our knowledge of this alkaloid is chiefly derived from cases of poisoning and over-dosing. The numbness, tingling, prickling and heat of the 2[Aconite ]provings are produced by the alkaloid, but with increased intensity. On local application, first there is sensation of warmth, then of burning with sharp pains and itching; finally numbness and anæsthesia. The symptoms often proceed from below upwards: "A tingling, prickling sensation, running up leg to spine and head, and tingling of fingers." "Ice-cold sensation creeps up from his feet." Fear of death, anguish, intense chilliness; feeling of sickness; constricting burning sensation, extending from mouth to stomach. Twitchings and spasms over whole body, especially in face. All symptoms are 2[> ]by vomiting. In one poisoning case "vomiting recurred every two or three minutes, and was performed by a sudden jerking action of abdominal muscles, accompanied by a loud shout, probably dependent on a sudden contraction of the diaphragm. Every attempt to swallow was followed by the spasmodic contractions So characteristic of hydrophobia, but they were not renewed by the sight of water. The slightest touch renewed the spasms." 2[Aconitine ]should be helpful in cases of hydrophobia, whether of the convulsive or the paralytic kind. The senses are disordered or lost-sight, hearing, smell. In one poisoning case the blindness was coincident with sudden dilatation of the pupils, and sight partially returned as the pupils contracted. A heavy feeling as of lead all over the body. All parts except head and stomach feel as if filled with lead. Neuralgia of 5th nerve. Creeping on face with feeling of swelling and tension. Pains in supraorbital nerve were especially prominent. Post-mortem examinations show the spleen very much enlarged; posterior part of liver dark and almost black. Kidneys hyperæmic}

S{The symptoms of 2[Aconitine ]set in with great rapidity, and develop with extreme intensity. If recovery occurs it is rapid and complete. There is relaxation of the limbs and every exertion 2[< ]the symptoms. 2[< ]By mental exertion; by agitation. 2[< ]By touch. Erect position 2[= ]nausea (M}
