:rubric=Characteristics.
S{R[Bor] has some very peculiar symptoms which will serve as keynotes to many cases. Chief among them are: (2[1]) Sensitiveness to sudden noises, as a distant shot, which causes violent starting. (It has cured "shot-shyness" in sporting dogs.) (2[2]) Intolerance of downward motions a child screams when nurse puts it into cot, or when she rocks it symptoms are worse going downstairs; sea-sickness (when the downward motion is felt most: "Every time the ship goes down, everything in me comes up"). Restlessness with ebullitions, especially after talking, with nausea. Laughter alternating with weeping. Cobweb sensations; sore mouth; infant pale, earthy, flesh flabby; screams out in sleep, wakes frightened and clings to nurse; excessively nervous, a slight noise arouses. Starts with pain. Muco-cutaneous surfaces are sore; in the eyelids there is ingrowing of lashes. Otorrhoea and inflammation of auricle: "starts with the pains." Nostrils ulcerated; soreness, pain and swelling of tip of nose. Aphthae; mouth of child feels hot to mother's nipple; child lets go nipple and cries with pain and vexation, or else refuses breast altogether. Diarrhoea with pain or soft yellow stools accompanying aphthae. Child screams before urinating (from inflammation of mucous membrane). Leucorrhoea clear, copious, albuminous, unnaturally hot. Painful nursing; pain after nursing; 2[empty] feeling in breasts; they ache because they are empty, B[>] by pressure: this is characteristic. Dysmenorrhoea (may be membranous), pain excessive during flow. Leucorrhoea preceding and following menses, albuminous, acrid. Herpetic eruptions; pleuritic symptoms (upper right chest) and cough, with expectoration of a mushy, mouldy odour. A notable symptom is: Before the easy stool in afternoon, fretful, ill-humoured, indolent, and discontented; after it, lively, contented, and cheerful. Another mental symptom is: Idles through the afternoon does not really get to work; changes from one business to another from one room to another. It is suited to the period of dentition; to persons with light hair; lax skins and muscles; wrinkled skin consequences of getting cold in cold and wet weather; riding eating fruit. Symptoms are B[<] in warm weather, B[<] after menstruation. Parts usually red turn white. Many Natrum symptoms appear in the proving. Stitching pains predominate.}
