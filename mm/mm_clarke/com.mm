:rubric=Characteristics.
S{R[Comocladia] shows its botanical affinity with the R[rhus-t] family by the virulence of its effects on the skin, the slightest contact, and, at times, even walking in the neighbourhood of the growing tree, being sufficient to cause violent inflammation. The trunk and branches of the tree contain a milky fluid, turning black on exposure to sunlight, discolouring the skin, linen, etc. (Compare the "Marking Nut" Anacardium.) The plant causes tormenting itching, swelling, redness, vesication, ulceration. Hale quotes from Navarro cures of ulcers: "Sloughing ulcer of right breast." "Indolent ulcer, lower third right leg," deep, discharging sanious fetid pus. "Inflammation of left leg and foot, with enormous swelling and fever." A cough, with pain under left breast going through to left scapula, has several times been cured with 2[R[Com]] The eye symptoms are peculiar: pain in right eye, sensation as if it were larger than left, and more protruded. There are also rheumatic pains, and, as with R[rhus-t], these and the symptoms in general are B[>] by motion and B[<] by rest. In contradistinction to R[rhus-t], heat B[<] and open air B[>] most of the symptoms. Most symptoms are B[<] at night as with R[rhus-t]. Pressure 2[>.]}
