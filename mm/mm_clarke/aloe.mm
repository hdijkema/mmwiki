:rubric=Characteristics.
S{R[Aloe] is one of the oldest and most famous drugs. It is in worldwide use as a purgative at the present day, and forms a leading ingredient in a large number of patent medicines for regulating the bowels and menstrual functions. The habitual use of these medicines leads to all kinds of pelvic ailments, and the fact that R[Sulph] antidotes R[Aloe] accounts for the success of R[Sulph] as a medicine to commence with in many chronic cases where purgatives have been used. R[Aloe] resembles R[All-s] somewhat closely. It causes congestion of various parts, especially abdomen, pelvic organs, and head. A periodicity enters into many of its complaints. There is a periodic headache which alternates with lumbago. As winter approaches each year itch manifests itself. R[Aloe] has the antipsoric property of throwing out internal complaints to the skin. Among the leading mental symptoms are: Bad humour, especially in cloudy weather. Dissatisfied and angry with himself 2[< ]when constipated. Aversion to labour. Lassitude alternating with great mental activity. Among the other head symptoms are: Darting pains in left temple 2[< ]every step. Carroll Dunham cured a heavy frontal incapacitating headache in an old man occurring in winter and alternating with a diarrhœa which occurred in summer when he was free from headache. A peculiar dull, heavy, pressing pain in forehead, but which indisposes to, or incapacitates for, all exertion, especially intellectual. Heaviness in the eyes as with R[All-s] Pressure in vertex and forehead as from a weight. Compelled to make the eyes small during pain in forehead. There are yellow rings moving before eyes. As there are illusions of sight, so there are cracklings in the ears. One symptom is very peculiar: just after getting into bed, sudden explosion and clashing in left ear, as from breaking of glass; the clink of the glass was heard at the bottom of the head and extended thence toward the right ear. R[Aloe] exerts its most marked influence on the abdominal and pelvic organs. It causes uneasiness and pains in liver region. Fulness, heaviness, heat and inflammation. The whole abdomen is painfully sensitive to touch. Rumbling. Feeling as of a plug wedged in between pelvis and coccyx. Sudden and continued desire to go to stool. Desire for stool after each meal (2[R[Ars], R[Chin], R[Lyc], R[Podo], R[Trom]; while] eating, R[Ferr]). Rumbling and cramp in abdomen before and during stool. The hard stool falls out without being noticed, urging to stool whilst passing water; every time on passing water feeling as if stool would pass. A hard stool may be passed involuntarily. A child, constipated from birth, screams all the time he is being held to stool, cannot pass it, even after enema; yet when not trying passes solid pieces in bed without knowing. Cured with R[Aloe] 200 (Nash). Involuntary soft stool while passing wind. With the diarrhœa, flatulency, pinching in abdomen, pain in back and rectum and chilliness. Flatus offensive, burning, copious; much flatus with small stool. Burning in anus with passing of flatus. Stools like mush, bright yellow, grey, hot, undigested. Mucus and blood in fæces. Profuse with jelly-like lumps. Watery stools 2[<s]tanding or walking. Watery stool containing lumps "like frog-spawn." Bilious yellow fæcal, bright yellow diarrhœa, great rumbling in bowels and escape of much wind, 2[< ]morning; evening; in damp weather; from overheating; after cold taken in damp room; after chagrin. Diarrhœa driving one out of bed very early in morning (R[Sulph]). Diarrhœa with sense of insecurity (R[Phos]) Faintness after stool; with cold sweat. Griping may (R[Nux-v]) or may not (R[Merc]) cease after stool. Heaviness, heat, pressing, burning in rectum. Itching, burning in rectum. Itching, burning, pulsating as from fissures at anus. After stool: cutting feeling as if more would come protruding piles. Hæmorrhoids: protrude like a bunch of grapes constant bearing-down in rectum bleeding; sore; tender, hot; 2[> ]by cold water. Carroll Dunham has cured incontinence of urine in an old man with enlarged prostate with the R[Aloe] diarrhœa. Increased sexual desire in males, with erections. Penis shrunk and testicles cold. In females pain in hypogastrium as if menses coming on. Labour-like pains drawing into legs. Menses too early and too profuse. During menstruation: headache 2[> ]by application of cold water; earache; pain in small of back; pressing down in rectum. Fulness in pelvis. Leucorrhœa of bloody mucus preceded by colic. Pain in small of back, 2[< ]sitting or awaking at night, 2[> ]moving about. Lumbago alternating with headache. There is 2[< ]in afternoon, especially of symptoms of mucous membranes. Many symptoms, again, appear in the evening 2[< ]yawning, or masticating. There is a diarrhœa 2[< ]in the early morning (like R[Sulph]). Diarrhœa 2[< ]immediately after eating; 2[< ]walking (2[R[Aesc], R[Thuj]]), or standing (R[Sulph]). Like R[Phos], it has feeling of insecurity on passing wind or before stool. Symptoms are 2[< ]from heat; in hot, damp weather; 2[> ]from cold applications; in cold weather. 2[> ]From passing flatus. 2[It is suited to:] old people; to women of relaxed phlegmatic habit; to persons of lymphatic or hypochondriac temperament}
