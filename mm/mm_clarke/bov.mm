:rubric=Characteristics.
S{"This globular fungus, which, according to report, is eaten in, Italy before it is ripe, becomes filled, while ripening, with a blackish dust that breaks the husk which contains it, with a slight noise." Corresponding to this signature, "bloatedness," puffy condition of body surface," and a sense of "enlargement," flatulent distension and noisy passage of flatus, are leading features of the R[Bov] pathogenesis. R[Bov] has cured cases of ovarian cyst; and also warts and corns, with shooting pains. There are ebullitions with great thirst. The corners of the mouth are broken out. Numb, pithy feeling in mouth. There is stuttering and stammering speech. Awkwardness, misapplies words in speaking and writing. Relaxation of entire capillary system; haemorrhagic diathesis; haemorrhage from menstrual irregularities; from traumatism. Menstrual flow occurring only or chiefly at night. Haemorrhage between the periods. The puffy, expanding properties of the remedy are shown in a puffy condition of the body surface; instruments (2[e.g.], scissors) indent the fingers in an unusual degree. The heart feels enormously large. R[Bov] has colic like R[Coloc], causing the patient to bend double, but it differs from R[Coloc] in that the colic is B[>] by eating and is sometimes accompanied by voiding of red urine. M. L. Sircar has recorded a striking cure of such a case with R[Bov] 3x, the pain being griping-twisting, intermittent, starting below umbilicus and diffusing itself towards epigastrium; some constipation; urine scanty and reddish. Nothing gave relief except eating. "Itching at top of coccyx" is another characteristic symptom. A case of cyst in broad ligament was cured, presenting these symptoms:} S{Metrorrhagia, flow at night or early morning, easily provoked from slight over-exertion during menses; can bear nothing tight round body; menses preceded and followed by diarrhoea; acrid corrosive leucorrhoea, flowing at night only, follows menses.} S{"We may always think of R[Bov] when we see a very "tettery" person, one who has tetters here and there, all over the body. These tetters may be either moist or dry" (Guernsey). Teste observed psoric eruptions appear on the hands and feet of a patient to whom he gave R[Bov] for headache. He cured with it a "red, crusty eruption on thighs and bends of knees of eighteen years' duration. It disappeared for weeks, reappearing in hot weather and at the full moon. W. S. Gee cured with R[Bov] 4, after the failure of R[Rhus-t], the following case. A widow, 55, had an eruption, which she thought to be erysipelas, on right foot. Some years before she had had an eruption on left foot, which discharged much water, and was "cured" by the use of a salve. A few months later the left knee became affected and the limb was amputated above the joint. The present eruption was fiery red, covered with yellowish-brown scales, thick as an old-fashioned wafer. There were also rheumatic pains in the leg. After R[Rhus-t] had been given without benefit, Dr. Gee elicited these additional symptoms: "Occasional spells of short breathing, especially from working with the hands. Sleep disturbed by burning and itching, and also by anxious, frightful dreams; headache when waking from sleep. Frequent desire to urinate, even immediately after urinating." These symptoms being found under R[Bov] in addition to "moist vesicular eruptions, with formation of thick crusts," the latter put in heavy type by Lilienthal, this medicine was given with steady improvement and eventual cure. Great weakness of the joints. Sensitive to touch, cannot bear clothing. Sensitive to draught, chilliness predominates. Early morning sweat B[<] on chest. Many symptoms are B[<] in early morning; the diarrhoea occurs then. Sweat of axilla smells like onions. Symptoms generally are B[<] morning; B[<] cold food; B[>] hot food. B[<] Hot weather; B[<] at full moon. Effects of over-exertion. Bending double B[>] colic; straightening up B[>] shooting pains between shoulders. R[Bov] antidotes effects of charcoal fumes. Easily intoxicated; B[<] from wine. B[<] From coffee.}
