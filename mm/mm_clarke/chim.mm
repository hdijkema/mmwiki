:rubric=Characteristics.
S{R[chim]. is a medicine used by many North American Indians in gravel and urinary disorders. It has also been used as a vulnerary. Among the eclectics it is used as an "alterative" in skin affections, I[e.g.], acne, herpes, eczema, in enlarged lymphatic glands, in articular rheumatism. It is said by them to act mainly as an eliminative through the bowels and kidneys. They use it in cases of chyliferous urine, cystitis, strangury, smarting, burning pains on urination, turbid urine and frequent micturition, and diabetes. Also in passive renal, uterine and intestinal haemorrhages, leucorrhoea and gonorrhoea. From its property of increasing the renal secretion they give it in cases of calculus and prostatic irritation. Catarrhal states, with mucus, muco-pus, pus and blood, offensive or not, indicate its use. R[chim]. has been proved by Jeanes, G. Bute, and H. P. Gatchell. It causes flushing of cheeks with some general heat and accelerated pulse. Toothache B[<] after eating, and from exertion; B[>] by cold water. Cannot close jaws at night; jaws feel stiff; sleeps with mouth open. Palate sore; very sensitive to warm drink or food; rawness of upper and back part of palate. Increase of appetite. It has been used with success in cases of: inflammation of liver with ascites; abdominal and renal dropsies; enlarged mesenteric glands; obstinate constipation and haemorrhoids. A peculiar symptom is: shooting pain, deep-seated, left side of anus. The symptom: "Sensation of swelling in perineum on sitting, as if a ball was pressing against it," shows its appropriateness in prostatic disorders. There is also loss of prostatic fluid. Constant pain in region of kidneys, as if something fluttering in kidney region, first one side, then the other. Pressing fulness in region of bladder. Vesical tenesmus; strangury. Constant desire to urinate; must rise several times in the night. Great quantities of thick, ropy mucus in urine. Blood in urine. Smarting pain (also painful irritation) from neck of bladder, whole length of urethra to meatus. Bruised pain in testicle is a leading indication in stricture. Leucorrhoea. Rapid atrophy of breasts or tumours. Acute rheumatism of shoulder. Oedema of arms (right). Inward trembling without mental disturbance.} 

In homoeopathic practice Coburn reports the following cures:  

1 S{Stricture: Man, 30, dysuria, severe pain, scalding and burning. At times urine voided in a large gush; at others in thready stream, and, towards the end, drained off drop by drop. (After 2[R[merc]. c.] and R[canth]. had relieved temporarily.)} 
1 S{Prostatitis after sitting on cold stone: Pain and a sensation in the parts, as if he had bruised one of the testicles.} 
1 S{Cancer of breast: Patient, 2l. Tumour in left breast, hard, movable; sharp pains at site. For four months, under 2[R[arn]., R[ars]., R[Cic], R[thuj].], the tumour increased, skin became contracted, nipple drawn in. In eight months it broke out into an irregular ulceration with lacerated edges, fetid discharge. Axillary glands swollen. R[chim]. Ã˜ gtt. x. every four hours was given, and the same locally applied. The pains diminished, swelling decreased, and in six months the patient was well. The symptoms of R[chim]. are B[<] In damp weather; after washing in cold water; from sitting on a cold, wet stone. (Though evergreens and "winter-lovers"} S{hence the name} S{the Chimaphilas are generally B[<] by cold). Suited to cachectic, scrofulous individuals and broken-down constitutions.}
