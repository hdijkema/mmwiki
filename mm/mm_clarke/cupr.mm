:rubric=Characteristics.
Metallic copper is an antipsoric remedy, working from within outwards. 
S{It ranks with the most important of those which relieve states arising from the "striking inward" of diseases or the failure of eruptions or discharges to appear.} S{It is this power to relieve internal spasm which renders it appropriate to the collapse stage of cholera, of which it is also, like R[sulph], a prophylactic either when worn next the skin, or when taken internally.} 

S{R[Cupr] produces many skin eruptions, and also foot-sweat, and it corresponds to these, and also to the effects of suppression of eruptions, exanthems, and foot-sweat; whether these effects be internal pains or spasms or oppression of the brain and mental disturbance.} 

Mackechnie made a brilliant cure of psoriasis in a young girl with R[Cupr]. 

The leading features of its symptomatology are: 
S{Cramps, convulsions, spasms of the most violent form, coming on from disappearance of pains, discharges, eruptions, mental derangement.}
S{With suppression of menses, patient screams.} 
S{Tonic spasms of thumbs.} 
S{Eyeballs turn up.} 
S{t[Opisthotonos|a state of severe hyperextension and spasticity in which an individual's head, neck and spinal column enter into a complete "bridging" or "arching" position].} 
S{Tonic and clonic spasms}. 

S{"Convulsions during pregnancy and puerperal convulsions which begin in the fingers or toes, and spread all over the body; or where there is great restlessness between the attacks, either filling up the entire interval, or only a part of the time."} Thus Guernsey. He also says that S{"a slimy metallic taste in the mouth"} is one of the strongest indications for R[cupr]. R[rhus-t] is the only other remedy which has this symptom so marked. 

S{"Cramps or spasms beginning in hands and feet, extending to belly,"} is confirmed by J. C. McLaren. 

Mossa regards R[cupr] as one of the remedies for S{the effects of fright}, and relates the case of a girl who, S{after a fright, was affected by involuntary motions of left arm and leg developing into pronounced general chorea}. R[cupr]. brought about slow but decided recovery. 
Another girl, 12, who had recovered from whooping-cough got a kind of S{chorea from repeated frights on seeing an epileptic. To the muscular movements was added silly behaviour: tongue heavy, speech slow, gait unwieldy. Frightened at night. Greediness in eating and drinking}. 
R[ign]., R[stram]., R[sulph]., did little good. She became ill-natured. R[cupr]. every four days cured completely in three months. 

Mackechnie reports the case of a boy who became S{epileptic after being locked up in school}. Very great improvement followed the administration of R[cupr]. 

Schwencke cured a case of S{epilepsy of forty years}' standing with R[cupr]. 6 after R[bell]. and R[hyos]. had done some little good. The patient was a man aged 45. S{The fits began suddenly towards morning with chewing motion of lower jaw; gnashing of teeth; becomes upright and rigid in bed; shrieks; limbs convulsed}. S{After giving way to violent anger, attacks become more severe; arms and legs were thrown outwards and trunk arched upwards}. R[cupr]. was now given. For a time the attacks continued severe, but gradually improvement set in, and in less than three months they ceased altogether. The "anger" in this case and the "ill-humour" in Mossa's are noteworthy. 

S{Maliciousness is an indication for R[cupr]}. 

In a second case cured by Schwencke, that of a man, 38, S{epileptic seven years}, a S{pressive headache preceded the attacks, ascending from nape to forehead; then there was profuse salivation, head turned to left, eyes closed, tongue in active motion in open mouth, trunk arched upward, slight spasms of right arm outward}. S{After attack, dulness of head, and feeling in body as if beaten}. 
R[cupr]. first removed the fits and then the dulness of the head. 

R[cupr]. has S{pains like knife-thrusts, B[<] on least motion; take away the breath, thinks he must die if they last}. S{Speaks in a whisper.} S{The thrusts go through to back from ensiform cartilage, from umbilicus.} S{Restless tossing all night.} S{Perfect stupor, with jerking of muscles.} S{Paralysis of isolated muscles.} 

Many unusual symptoms are produced, including S{maliciousness and desire to injure.} S{Screaming, with cerebral or mental symptoms.} S{Loquacious.} S{Violent head pains B[<] over left eye.} S{Brain seems paralysed.} S{Chlorosis from abuse of iron.} S{Vomiting, hiccoughs, and spasms B[>] by drink of cold water.} S{Over-sensitiveness of skin, especially in region of stomach and fourth and fifth dorsal vertebrae.} 

S{Touch and pressure I[<.]} S{B[<] Before menses; from vomiting.} S{Symptoms are B[<] evening and night.} S{Cold air and cold wind B[<]; cold drinks B[>] (colic, cough etc.).} S{Wrapping head B[>] headache.} S{B[<] At new moon.} S{Periodicity every 15, 30, or 60 minutes; every fortnight.} S{Getting wet B[=] epileptic attacks.} S{B[>] From being mesmerised; during perspiration.} 
S{Suited to fair-haired people; and the carbo-nitrogenoid constitution.} S{Women who have borne many children (after-pains).}
