:rubric=Characteristics.
S{2[Cadmium] is found in nature in intimate association with 2[Zinc], which it nearly resembles in action, but 2[Cadmium] acts more powerfully. The profound action of R[Cadm-s]. on the stomach} S{burning and cutting pain, intense retching, gagging, bringing up tough mucus, intense nausea and vomiting} S{led to its being given in yellow fever with brilliant success. Black vomit is very characteristic. The least thing touching the lips will excite vomiting. Pitchy taste; food tastes like salt. 2[R[Cadm]] is a cross between R[Bry]. and R[Ars].: it has the desire to keep quiet of R[Bry]., with the exhaustion and stomach irritability of R[Ars]. (Kent). 2[Cadmium] is a chilly medicine. There is icy coldness} S{coldness even when near a fire. Horripilation: after drinking; with hot hands. Sweat in axillae. Effect of a draught of cold air in checking sweat. B[<] From cold air; itching of skin when cold. B[<] Sunshine. B[<] In morning and after sleep. B[<] Walking; B[<] ascending stairs. B[<] When swallowing. B[<] After grief. B[<] After intoxication. B[>] By eating. Effects of: anxiety, or fit of passion; of cold winds (facial paralysis). Acts well in drunkards. It is a notable antipsoric. There is much itching of skin; at night in bed; when touched; when cold; B[>] scratching, which causes a voluptuous feeling. Skin blue; yellow; scaly, cracking, damp, suppurating herpes; chilblains. Cutting, lancinating pains are prominent; also a sense of constriction. The nasal symptoms are very important; no remedy has served me better in cases of ozaena and polypus.}
