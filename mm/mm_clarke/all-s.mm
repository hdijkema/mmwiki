:rubric=Characteristics.
S{Teste places R[All-s] in the R[Bry] group along with R[Lyc], R[Dig], R[Nux-v], R[Coloc], R[Ign], all of which act with much power on carnivorous animals and hardly at all on herbivora. All are suited to persons who are disposed to excesses at table, have strong constitutions, dark complexions, firm flesh, though occasionally disposed to obesity. The R[All-s] patient is rather a gourmand than a glutton. It suits persons who eat a great deal more than they drink. In the mental sphere there is anxiety and impatience. Fears he won't recover; that he won't be able to bear any medicine; fear of being poisoned. Teste has cured with it, chronic dyspepsia in old, fleshy persons, whose bowels were deranged by the least irregularity of diet; chronic bronchial catarrh with profuse mucous expectoration; periodical asthma; a case of permanent dyspnœa; rheumatism of hip; swelling of breasts after weaning. He also greatly relieved with it cases of diabetes mellitus. The pains of R[All-s] are mostly pressive from within outward (i.e., distensive, like those of R[Bry]); stinging, or stinging and burning; or stinging with paralytic weakness; or tearing and crampy. Sometimes they increase gradually to a high point and then decrease gradually (like R[Sulph] and R[Stann]). Garlic has been used as a condiment from ancient times, and also as a remedy against worms and fevers. Though closely related to R[All-c] it is incompatible with it, and not very like it in action. It produces headache in connection with digestive troubles and also with menstruation. Heavy headache, can hardly open eyes, 2[> ]onset of menses, 2[<]after. Catarrhal ophthalmia returning every night on trying to read. Coryza, moist, dry, thin, fluent, with pressive pains above root of nose. Scurvy gums; sore mouth. R[All-s] is one of the remedies for "hair" sensation: Sensation of hair on tongue 2[< ]reading. (Many of the pains of R[All-c] are 2[thread-like.]) Copious sweetish saliva. The digestion is disordered by slightest irregularities in diet. Pressure in epigastrium and transverse colon 2[> ]by pressure and sitting bent. The menses are profuse. During menses there is soreness of vulva and thighs, mammæ swollen and painful to touch. There are some characteristic respiratory symptoms. Bronchial catarrh with gelatinous, difficult expectoration. Cough, giving rise to most fetid breath like R[Caps]. Cough when smoking. The hip is the seat of many rheumatic pains. Tearing in hip. Pain in psoas and iliac muscles 2[< ]least movement, though he can lift the limb with the hands. The skin is sensitive, dry, shrivelled. Herpetic itching, burning, red or whitish spots on swollen surface. Baldness; scurf, skin peels off hand. The skin over joints is tight}

S{It is suited to fleshy people and those used to high living. Change of temperature 2[<.] Open air 2[< ]chest complaints. Moist heat 2[< ]pains in limbs. Damp cold weather 2[= ]tearing and stinging in different parts of body. Reading 2[< ]eye and mouth symptoms. Aggravation from reading is noteworthy. It is found also under R[Cina]. The vertigo of R[All-s] is brought on by looking long and steadily at anything: this is probably, in essence, the same modality as 2[< ]by reading. Many symptoms are 2[< ]in evening and night; also in the morning on waking. Sitting bent 2[>;] pressure 2[< ]pains in abdomen. Every step 2[=]excruciating pain in intestines. Walking 2[< ]pains in limbs}
