A girl who ate half an unripe fruit manifested the following: Completely out of her mind in a quarter of an hour, dizzy, sleepy; slept with eyes open; if disturbed, sprang up raving and uttered unintelligible words; 2[if one sang she began to dance in the Javanese fashion].

This symptom may prove a keynote in certain cases of mental alienation.
