GT{Angustura falsa. Nucis vomicae cortex. N. O. Loganiaceae. Tincture or trituration.}


:rubric=Clinical.
S{Abdomen, throbbing in. Headache.}


:rubric=Characteristics.
S{Under the name of 2[Brucea antidysenterica] a quantity of Nux vomica bark got upon the drug market, and was at first supposed to be Angustura bark. Many poisonings ensued before the mistake was discovered, and the bark received the name 2[Augustura falsa], in contradistinction to the true Angustura. It contains strychnine, and the symptoms are included in the pathogenesis of R[Nux-v] and R[Stry]. The homoeopathic preparation of R[Nux-v] is, however, prepared from the seed. One characteristic symptom of 2[Brucea antidysenterica] (2[i.e.], the 2[bark] preparation) is: "Headache with extreme drowsiness; disappearing in evening." Another is: "Sensation of throbbing in pit of stomach and in entire abdomen." (Although the symptoms are included in the pathogenesis of R[Nux-v] as the bark has been experimented with independently, I subjoin the Schema.)}
