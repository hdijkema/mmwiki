:rubric=Characteristics.
S{I[Aralia] was used by the old herbalists and by eclectics as a remedy in phthisis and coughs, and also for leucorrhśa and other complaints of women whose secretions are acrid or suppressed. The homśopathic uses have been chiefly based on a proving by Dr. S. A. Jones, in whom it developed an attack of asthma. The symptoms were: Loud wheezing respiration coming on immediately on lying down at midnight; and he particularly noted that inspiration was very loud and more difficult than expiration. The right lung appeared more affected than the left. On turning to left side, left side seemed affected, and right side became quite free. As the attack passed off phlegm came more freely, had a salty taste, and felt warm in the mouth. The characteristic cough, according to Burnett, is "a fit of coughing occurring before midnight, either immediately on lying down or 2[more commonly] after a short sleep." Cough occurring at 11 p.m., after a short sleep. Profuse perspiration whilst asleep. Dr. Jones also experienced diarrhśa and prolapse of rectum; soft yellow stools; after stool an aching pain in the rectum, extending upwards on the left side}
