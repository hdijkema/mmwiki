:rubric=Characteristics.
S{R[Am-m] is less prominently a right-side medicine than R[Am-c]; Guernsey regards it as rather left-sided. It acts specially also on the forehead. It causes ulceration and ulcerative pains; also dislocation-like pains and tension as if tendons were contracted. Both cause paralytic weakness; both are B[<] in open air. R[Am-m] has B[>] from warm bath. R[Am-c] has greater sensibility to cold and to damp weather than the muriate. Both have itching eruptions of all kinds; drowsiness by day with indolence; shivering in the evening. The mental state is very similar in the two. The muriate has perhaps more melancholy and disposition to tears than the other, and it has peculiar to itself "antipathy to certain persons." R[Am-m] has fear of darkness, like R[Stram], which is not noted under R[Am-c] The muriate has fulness in head; weight in forehead. Burning in eyes in twilight or in morning with photophobia. Keratitis. Ulceration in corners of mouth. Sensation in stomach as if fasting, which nevertheless feels full; B[<] after breakfast. Intermittent pains in both hypochondria. Stitches and burning in liver region, stitches in spleen B[<] sitting. Tension in either groin. Shootings in scapula and ice-cold sensation between scapulæ, unrelieved by external wraps. In the fever chilliness predominates. Choudhury cured with it a case of intermittent characterised by absence of thirst in all stages. Constipation and piles with bleeding at stool. Sore, smarting hæmorrhoids. Hard stool covered with mucus; mucous secretions generally increased. Menses too early and too copious (R[Am-c]), with pains in loins. Vomiting, diarrhœa, and neuralgic pains in feet during period. Coryza, acrid, watery; scalding hot; with cold feeling between shoulders. Loss of smell. Cough and asthmatic symptom B[<] evening and at night and B[<] in open air. Pain as from ulceration at tips of fingers. Neuralgic pains in stumps of amputated limbs (R[All-c]).
