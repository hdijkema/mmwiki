S{This is an unproved remedy, but it has irritant properties like the other Ranunculaceae. Hansen gives as indications: "Pemphigus; bullae are surrounded by a ring, much itching. On the third day they are transformed into crusts." Cooper has used it with excellent effect in a case of uterine cancer, giving single doses of the Ã˜ tincture at long intervals.}
