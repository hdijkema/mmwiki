:rubric=Characteristics.
S{R[Ars] is the horse's remedy; as R[Puls] is the sheep's, and R[Ant-c] the pig's. The reprehensible fashion of "doctoring" horses with R[Ars] is merely an abuse of a therapeutic fact. The horse is an animal on whose power of endurance and "wind" enormous demands are made, and R[Ars] is the remedy for the effects of feats of prolonged endurance. The R[Ars] habit of the Styrian mountaineers has arisen from the discovery of its power of strengthening the muscles both of the limbs and of the breathing apparatus. But in another way the horse typifies the R[Ars] temperament. The mental symptoms of my drug, when pronounced, carry precedence of all others. The horse is an exceedingly nervous animal, constantly moving about, restless to a degree, and very prone to take fright.} S{Quite a picture of the R[Ars] temperament. According to Teste R[Ars] acts much more powerfully on vegetable-eating animals than on carnivora (opp. R[Nux-v]); and it is suited to the effect's of excess of vegetable diet, melons, strawberries, and fruits in general, especially watery fruits}

S{The arsenic-eaters of the Tyrol can take as much as six grains of white arsenic, or the sulphide, every two days. They maintain that it imparts a sense of invigoration and enables them to carry enormous loads up perpendicular mountains. According to one account it is resorted to by populations who live on vegetable food almost exclusively. "It strengthens the muscles," an old indulger in the habit is reported to have said, "helps to digest our coarse bread and potatoes, and allows us to breathe freely and easily. Meat-eaters have no need for such a thing, but with us it is a necessity." It is difficult to say how far this is a directly "tonic," effect, and how far curative of the dyscrasia generated by the conditions of life. The fine skin and glossy hair of the young women among the arsenic-eating populations is remarkable, and is comparable to the fine coats of arsenic-fed horses. On the other hand, "staring coat" in animals, and "dry, rough, scaly, unhealthy-looking skin" in human beings are keynote indications for the remedy. In this connection may be mentioned the effects on the crew of the ship 2[Zion], which carried arsenic as a portion of its cargo. This was exposed somewhat to the sun's rays, and the crew noticed a peculiar smell. Soon they all began to notice themselves growing stout, and on reaching Philadelphia from England they had all gained much, one to the extent of two stones in weight}

S{Restlessness is one of the grand characteristics of R[Ars] Even the stupor of R[Ars] is interrupted by fits of restlessness with anxious moaning. Patients are anxious, full of the fear of death, restlessness compelling them to frequently change their position. Hence the applicability of the drug in many nervous affections, notably chorea. Jerks and starts on falling asleep. Irritability, desperately angry; almost furious. Despair, hopelessness, unutterable misery. The irritability and sadness of malarial cachexias; of the cachexias of quinine, mercury, and syphilis. Low types of disease; typhoid states. Inflammations of great intensity with tendency to destruction of tissue. Burning, lancinating pains. 2[Burning] is another of the leading characteristics of Arsenic. No other remedy has it in more pronounced degree. The peculiarity of the "burnings" of R[Ars] is that they are B[>] by heat (herein comparing with 2[Capsic.]). The burning in the throat is B[>] by eating or drinking hot things. On the other hand cold food and cold drinks B[<] stomach irritations; hence R[Ars] is of signal use for effects of eating ices and drinking ice-water. R[Ars] affects the entire alimentary tract. The lips are so dry and parched and cracked that the patient often licks them to moisten them. The mouth is aphthous, ulcerated, or gangrenous. The stomach is so irritable that the least food or drink causes distress or vomiting, or stool or both together. Abdominal pains are intense, causing the patient to turn and twist. Hćmorrhoids are exceedingly painful as if burning needles plunged in. States of lowered vitality. The 2[Prostration] of R[Ars] is remarkable. With it there is the desire to move or be moved constantly. The patient is exhausted from the slightest exertion. Exhaustion is not felt while lying still, but as soon as he moves he is surprised to find himself so weak. The prostration seems out of proportion to the rest of his illness. Must lie down. Exhaustion from hill-climbing, breathless, sleepless. Thirst for little and often (R[Ant-t], R[Lyc]), wants it very cold and immediately rejects it (R[Phos] as soon as it becomes warm). Before and after the cough of R[Ars] there is an attack of asthma (R[Phos]) Arsen. has a great place in acute coryza and hay-fever. The fluent coryza is corrosive, reddening the upper lip, and has more burning than either R[Merc] or R[Cepa] Also it is B[<] out of doors, and B[>] in warmth, which distinguishes it from R[Cepa] especially. R[Ars] is predominantly right-sided. The neuralgias affect the right side most; the right lung ("acute, sharp, fixed or darting pain in apex and through upper third of right lung") is more affected than the left; also the right side of the abdomen, hence typhlitis. Many dropsical conditions are controlled by R[Ars] Especially has it done brilliant work in cases of hydrothorax. It has been called the "liquid trochar," on account of the expeditions way in which it will remove a watery effusion. The patient cannot lie down; must sit up to breathe; anxious; restless; B[<] about 1 a.m}

S{It is suited to the full plethoric habit. Puffiness in one of its characteristics; and from this to dropsy. All mucous membranes are irritated. The skin is cold and clammy. Scurfy eruptions. Bran-coloured scales on head coming down to forehead. 2[Arsenic] has cured epithelioma of the lips and closely corresponds to the cancerous diathesis. Many cures of cancer have been reported under its use, both in the crude and in potencies. When the subjective symptoms of 2[Arsen.] are present, it will cure in the potencies. When the homśopathicity is more crude the lower potencies will be required: in this case the 2[Arsen.] appears to act directly on the cancerous tissue and cancerous elements in the system}
S{R[Ars] is a hemorrhagic: it acts on both blood and blood-vessels. Varices burn like fire. Anćmia, chlorosis, pyćmia all come within the scope of 2[Arsenic], which corresponds also to states resulting from losses of blood, as venesection, metrorrhagia, hćmoptysis}

S{The Conditions, especially of time and temperature, are all-important with 2[Arsenic.] Unless these correspond in the patient, failure will be more frequent than success. 2[Arsenic] is one of the greatest of periodics. I once treated some members of a family who all had attacks of fever of short duration, recurring regularly every six weeks, from living in rooms papered with arsenical papers. Its periods are: every day; every third or fourth day; every fortnight; every six weeks; every year. There is pronounced night aggravation, the pains are unsupportable with restlessness. B[<] Midnight and after (2[Acon.] is rather before midnight); B[<] 3 a.m. There is B[<] from cold and damp; B[>] warmth. 2[Arsen.] loves warmth like 2[Nux v., Psor., Hepar, Silic., Mag. mur.] and other hydrogenoids, and herein is differentiated from 2[Sul., Ant. crud., Iod., Apis], and 2[Puls.] 2[Arsen.] hugs the fire and likes warm wraps. B[<] Lying on affected side, or with head low. B[>] Lying with head high}


:rubric=Relations.
S{2[Antidotes:] To poisonous doses-milk, albumen, demulcent drinks, followed by emetics of mustard, Sulphate of Zinc or Sulphate of Copper (Tartar emetic is too irritating). Castor oil is the best purgative. 2[Chemical antidotes:] Animal charcoal, Hydrated peroxide of iron, Magnesia, Limewater. 2[Dynamic antidote:] Opium; it may be administered by clyster if not retained on stomach. Brandy and stimulants if there is depression and collapse. If urine is suppressed, Sweet spirits of nitre in large quantities of water}
S{2[Antidotes of potencies:] Camph., Chi., Chin. sul., Fer., Graph., Hep., Iod., Ipec., Nux v., Sambuc., Tabac., Verat. 2[Arsen. is] 2[antidote to:] Carb. v., Chi., Fer., Graph., Hep., Iod., Ipec., Lach., Merc., Nux v., Phos., Sambuc., Strych., Tabac., Verat. 2[Follows well:] Aco., Agar., Arn., Bell., Cham., Chi., Ipec., Lach., Verat. 2[Followed well by:] Aran. d., Nux v., Iod., Sul. Rhus follows well in skin affections, especially in cases treated allopathically with large doses of arsenic. 2[Complementary:] All. sat., Carb. v., Phos. 2[Similar to:] Aco., Apoc., Arg. n., Bell., Bism., Calc., Can. ind., Carb. v., Chi., Ferr., Hyo., Ipec., Kreos. Lach., Lyc., Nux v., Phos., Puls., Rhus t., Sil., Tab., Verat. The restlessness of Ars. differs from that of Mag. c.; Ars. goes from room to room, from bed to bed; Mag. c. must get out of bed and walk the floor to relieve pain. The fear of death is not that of Acon., but is an anxiety and a feeling that it is useless to take medicine as they will surely die (more like Agnus). Bry. drinks much and seldom: Ars. little and often; Ars. eats much at a time, Bry. often and little}
