R[Taurocholate of soda] in Homeopathy. - Dr. I. P. Tessier, in an interesting study of the action of bile and its salts, in hepatic affections, analyzes a number of experiments by leading authorities, with the object of determining this action, and concludes that in the R[Taurocholate of Soda], homeopathy has a useful remedy against certain forms of hypoglobular anaemia. The claim that its pathogenesis and toxicology clearly indicate its value, and that it should also serve us as a remedy in cases of hypertrophy of the spleen and ganglia. He calls our attention to the fact, that it produces dyspnoea, the Cheyne-Stokes rhythm, acute pulmonary oedema, and intense exaggeration of the cardiac pulsations, offering a good field for clinical studies and experimentation of great interest, which may give fruitful and important results.
