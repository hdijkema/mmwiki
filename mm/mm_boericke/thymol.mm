R[Carbon Tetrachloride] as a remedy for Hookworms, according to Dr. Lambert, Suva, Fiji who employed it in 50,000 cases.

1 Carbon tetrachloride is a vermifuge and vermicide of great potency, and has shown itself to be the best vermifuge for the treatment of hookworm in a country where the disease predominates.
1 It gives little discomfort to the patient, is palatable, required no preparation of the patient, and when pure is apparently not toxic-all of which features are of advantage in a popular campaign.

"W. G. Smillie, and S. B. Pessoa, of Sao Paulo, Brazil, also have found carbon tetrachloride to be extremely efficient in removing hookworms. A single dose of 3 Cc given to adults has been proved to remove 95 per cent of all the hookworms harbored".
