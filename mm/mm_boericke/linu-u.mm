The application of Linseed poultice has produced in sensitive subjects severe respiratory disturbances, as asthma, hives, etc. Its action in such cases is marked by 2[intense irritation]. It has been found to contain small quantity of Hydrocyanic acid, which may account for this intensity. The decoction is of service in inflammation of the urinary passages, cystitis, strangury, etc. Also in diseases of the intestinal tract. It has a place in the treatment of asthma, hay-fever and urticaria. Trismus and paralysis of the tongue.
