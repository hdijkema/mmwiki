Pain of cancer. Warts). Also R[Egg Vaccine for Asthma]. Much interest is shown in Dr. Fritz Talbot's method to cure one form of asthma in children by the use of egg vaccine. Asthma due to susceptibility of the proteid substance in eggs can be cured by immunizing against egg poisons by repeated doses of egg white. After the skin has been cleansed with soap and alcohol the egg-white is rubbed into a slight scratch.
