:rubric=generals
This fungus contains several toxic compounds, the best known of which is 2[Muscarin]. The symptoms of poisoning do not develop at once, usually twelve to fourteen hours elapse before the initial attack. There is no antidote, treatment, entirely symptomatic (Schneider). Agaricus acts as an intoxicant to the brain, producing more vertigo and delirium than alcohol, followed by profound sopor with lowered reflexes.

:rubric2=compare
S{R[Muscin], the alkaloid of Agaricus (has much power over secretions, increasing lachrymal, salivary, hepatic, etc, but diminishing renal; probably neurotic in origin, stimulating the terminal fibers of the secretory nerves of all these structures, hence 2[salivation], 2[lachrymation and excessive perspiration]. R[Atro] exactly opposes R[Muscin]. Resembles R[Piloc] in action).} 
S{R[Amanita vernus]-spring mushroom-a variety of R[Agar-ph]-Death cup-active principle is R[Phallin], active like Muscarine.}
S{R[Amanita phalloides] (Death Cup-Deadly Agaric). The poison is a toxalbumin, resembling the poison in the rattle snake and the poison excreted by the cholera and diphtheria germs. It acts on the red blood corpuscles, dissolving them so that blood escapes into the alimentary canal and the whole system is drained. The amount of this toxic principle is small, even handling of specimens and breathing of spores affects some people unpleasantly. The poison is slow in development. Even 12 to 20 hours after taking it the patient feels all right, but vertigo violent choleraic symptoms with rapid loss of strength with death the second or third day, preceded by stupor and spasms. Fatty degeneration of liver, heart and kidneys, haemorrhages in lungs, pleura and skin (Dr. J. Schier). Vomiting and purging. Continuous urging to stool, but no gastric, abdominal or rectal 2[pain]. Intense thirst for cold water, dry skin. Lethargic but mentally clear. 2[Sharp changes] from rapid to slow and from slow to rapid breathing, extreme collapse, suppressed urine, but no cold extremities or cramps.}
S{R[Agar-em] (severe vertigo; all symptoms 2[better], 2[cold water], 2[longing for ice-water]; gastritis cold sweat, vomiting sensation as if stomach was suspended on a string).} 
S{R[Tam] (chilblains and freckles).}
R[Cimic], R[Cann-i], R[Hyos], R[Tarent].
