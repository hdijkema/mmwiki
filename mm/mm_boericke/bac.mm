:rubric=generals
Has been employed successfully in the treatment of tuberculosis; its good effects seen in the change of the sputum, which becomes decreased and more aerated and less purulent. Many forms of chronic non-tubercular disease are influenced favorably by Bacillinum, especially when bronchorrhoea and dyspnoea are present. S{Respiratory pyorrhea}. 2[The patient expectorates less.]

S{Bacillinum is especially indicated for lungs of old people, with chronic catarrhal condition and enfeebled pulmonary circulation, attacks of suffocation at night with difficult cough}. S{Suffocative catarrh}. S{Tubercular meningitis}. S{Favors falling off of tartar of teeth}. S{Constant disposition to take cold}.

S{Abdominal pains, enlarged lands in groins, tabes mesenterica}. S{Sudden diarrhoea before breakfast}. S{Obstinate constipation, with offensive flatus}. 

:rubric=respiratory
S{2[Oppression]}. S{2[Catarrhal dyspnoea]}. S{2[Humid asthma]}. S{2[Bubbling rales and muco-purulent expectoration]}. Note: This muco-purulent expectoration of bronchitic patients is equally poly-bacillary; it is a mixture of diverse species and hence Bacillinum is truly indicated (Cartier). Often relieves congestion of the lungs, thus paving way for other remedies in Tuberculosis.

:rubric2=compare
S{Its effects seem to be identical to that of Koch's Tuberculinum (R[Tub-k]).} S{Both are useful in the tubercular diathesis before phthisis had developed.} S{In the 2[early stages] of tubercular disease of glands, joints, skin and bones.} S{R[Psor] Seems to be its chronic equivalent.} S{R[Bac-ts] acts especially on lower half of the body.}

:rubric=dose
The does is important. Should not be given below the thirtieth and not repeated frequently. One dose a week often sufficient to bring about reaction. It is 2[rapid in action], and good results ought to be seen, otherwise there is no need of repetition.
