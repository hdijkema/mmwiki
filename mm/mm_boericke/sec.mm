:rubric=dose
First to thirtieth potency. 2[Non-homeopathic use]. In haemorrhages of the puerperium, after the uterus in entirely emptied, when it fails to contract satisfactorily and in secondary puerperal haemorrhage the result of incomplete involution of the uterus, give one-half to one dram of the fluid extract. Remember Pagot's law. "As long as the uterus contains, anything, be it child, placenta, membranes, clots, never administer Ergot".
